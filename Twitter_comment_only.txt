Most western articles abt China fall into one of two ditches; either  1) China's successes imply a nearby democratization, or,  2) since the chinese are so different from us and our political system, their success is a balloon that will soon pop. This article was a good no. 2.
From If China can’t cultivate free thinkers, it will always be a follower and never a leader as the West imagines and invents the future, writes
This “Surveillance balloon from China” story smells like a CIA psyop.
Pretty much everything is a CIA psyop now. I mean, literally everything. Seriously.
Could the opening of the USA ’s 1000 foreign military base, which now means they encircle China have any bearing? Let’s see some close up pics.
Modified take on their UFO ops which they've been running since the 1950s.
nailed it. modern day "weapons of mass destruction" gig. so, I should believe a nation like China... doing better economically at home &amp; abroad than USA, but 4 some reason is risking war 2 spy on nothing important. they don't FEAR USA militarily/economically, BUT, USA FEARS THEM.
Big time
Got to be a weather balloon that got away from them
Is this based on your extensive knowledge of CIA psyops?
I haven’t even heard about this but “Balloon” anything sounds like an op immediately lmao
At this point assume everything is and, if it's not, be pleasantly surprised.
probably CGI and gaslighting the population with more psyop circus.
Life is just one psy-op after another in 21st Century CIA-land.
Yeah, China has high tech satellites, why would they send a balloon? And why didn't anyone or anything see it while it was passing above Alaska? And Canada? Especially considering the issues between the US and Russia atm. Smells like BS for sure
So do you
It's the latest shiny ball and effective because people actually believe that China only uses a big white balloon to spy on us. Incredible if it wasn't so pathetically ignorant.
Apparently derived from a 19th century spy book on how to spook people. I think we should've shot cannonballs at it.
This is pure theatrics, what better way to distract from evidence coming out you are an agent of China than having a china spy balloon to make it seem like an adversarial relationship.   Biden is an agent of china
Biden should shoot down the Chinese spy balloon immediately.  President Trump would have never tolerated this.  President Trump would have never tolerated many things happening to America.
The Pentagon wanted to shoot down China's spy balloon hovering over Montana but "Sleepy Joe" told em "nah it doesn't pose a risk to US security"! What planet are you from moron?? SMH
Can't even compare that giant spy balloon from China to Sputnik
#DOD says high altitude balloon over Montana yesterday was a spy balloon from #China. I did a quick run of the #NOAA HYSPLIT model to trace backwards the path of an object. Using 14K meters  over Montana yesterday I get the following - Yup Central China! https://t.co/FHiG79f4th https://t.co/DeZLjjkPei
Really useful - many thanks!
Holy hell
If HYSPLIT is right, it went over SKorea, Japan and Canada before Montana. NOBODY kicked up a fuss but now everybody is hysterical because the Pentagon "believes" it's PRC? How does it "spy" if it doesn't emit electronic signals? Why use low tech when PRC has real spy satellites?
Bet they send one over whenever a polar trough digs south.  Also, why wouldn’t the balloon continue to rise and expand, then pop like a NWS balloon?
We spend way too much on defense.
wonder why they were in Montana…
There are unmanned silos in Montana.
These are in the same area as the CCP spy balloon
Earlier this week a Canadian CP 104 Aurora was circling overhead in the interior of BC. I wonder if this is what it was looking at.
 “Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee…” 
 the chance of this getting over Alaska unseen are zero.
Truth. It’s just not that big of a deal.
Yes, but they change hourly and by altitude.
This is infuriating.   This thing flew through Alaska and Canada and we are just now noticing it?   Like wtf we have a literal aircraft over the continental us and it's like no big deal
I think it was noticed over Alaska, but does not seem much of a threat. Spy satellites will do a much better job. Can’t really aim a balloon.  Not sure what it’s for, but I cannot see a reason to be alarmed about it.
Canada didn't notice this thing?
So we have a 1 trillion defense budget, and that thinf could fly all the way over Alaska and Canada without notice?  They either let it happen   This is a Hollywood story   or the military is lacking somewhere...
Can we fly a spy balloon over other countries without them "being alarmed about it"? Maybe over the concentration camps in China? WTH?
How about ....
Alaska didn’t notice this thing?
Must have been a ghost
Or they didnt "just now" find out. But I'm going with Hollywood story
Even if they didn't find out today. That thing went through Alaska and Canada, like doing some free tour. This could be a hell of a Hollywood story 
I vaguely remember that a couple of balloons from Japan appeared over the US during WWII.
Yes, I believe there was one death from a Japanese balloon in WW2.
Six in Gearhart  Mountain, Oregon in May of 1945.
I think there was an episode about this on or I know I've listened to the story
What's the point of spy balloons when spy satellites exist?
This is so laughable.... IC gang, you are going to have to do WAY BETTER psyops than this...
How long until Kim Jong Un is launching balloons?
How long did it take to get from a to b?
Is that the time on the bottom? 6hr intervals?
The exact way Russian or Chinese aircraft would enter American airspace. This isn't about ICBMs. It's about seeing anti-air capabilities. People have no idea how serious this is or what it means is coming... Too distracted by all the other nonsense.
It was spotted Feb 2 at 12pm EST in Costa Rica
I'm curious- have they developed enough control of stratospheric balloons that they could know it would 1) reach the US and 2) hang around?  (It's a balloon not a plane so presumably it will have to drift down at some point we'll have answers then.)
As far as controlling it, there is not much you could do except raise and lower. No way you could aim for a target 5000km away! You could do some partial steering but above 40k ft, the winds are usually going at a good clip. To use to spy, I would think is not at all viable.
Have we forgotten project LOON? They were able to maneuver their balloons quite easily (although slowly) at 60k feet by using freely available NOAA wind speed and direction data. In about a week’s time they maneuvered one from  Nevada to Porto Rico.
Lol?  LOON LLC.  You’ve been out of school too long. Look it up.  Someone at Wikipedia already did the research for you.
Exactly how do we know China isn’t establishing this spy balloon as to front run for a future EMP attack over America, as we did over certain Japanese cities in WWII as a set-up for the atomic bombs?
Lol. For the same reason we aren’t. Physics. SMH
Did you see this ?
Yes. We’ve been running similar trajectory models.
Yes, this is *backtracking* the course of the balloon, not predicting where it will go in the future. You might also note that the accuracy of this estimate--based largely on data, hey! collected by balloons--is still only good enough to come within a few hundred miles.
So, it's not possible to launch a balloon and predict it's course? I thought people have been doing that for years. I'm not saying China was aiming for Montana... but it seems reasonable to think they launched it with intent to hit US.
You can predict it's course *generally* over the space of a few hundred miles. But as distance increases, accuracy falls sharply. Think of it as trying to predict the weather over every foot of space between where you launch and where you're going, for days.
Alright, thanks. It is odd that DoD seems to think it is some intentional spy device tho.
Or very likely, they knew it's not intentional but declared it so anyway. Why do you think they would do that?
Disappointed in the state of #Montana How in the world hasn’t some local used to laser or other mechanisms to pop that balloon.
I would like to know where is the common sense in all of this is how was this allowed?
Common sense…you’re looking at the wrong regime for that…
Excellent work.   It might *look* like a spy balloon. It could be carrying an EMP.  Why is the Pentagon "continuing to monitor"?  Where is the Commander in
Civilian Action against the balloon incoming.
doesn't have these problems
Where is the outrage over USA using balloons to spy on China?
Recalibrate for flat earth model please, thanks!
If I were the White House spokesman last week, I would have prepared the following announcement, BEFORE it entered US airspace.  They were dumb to think this thing would go unnoticed, and not become a PR nightmare.
Is there a way to see likely future trajectory?
So, does this balloon behave like a weather balloon gone awry?
Is seems to be at an altitude around 50,000ft, and drifting with the wind at that height. Weather balloons are much smaller, and designed to “pop”, allowing the radiosonde (the instruments measuring temperature and dew point) to parachute back to the surface for hopeful recovery.
It's fascinating that China amazingly found a jet stream that would take this intel balloon exactly over S. Korea, Japan, Alaska, and then swing down to Montana.
At least someone out there can accurately predict the weather.
Interesting. Good work
#ShootItDown
And our government if that’s what you want to call it didn’t know???? Lmaoooo
Explain this like I’m 5
Knew where it was headed
Are they able to navigate this balloon or is it just drifting?
Well done. Very nice.
Possibly carrying more deadly virus? maybe nano technological weapon? why else would they not shoot it down?
Is this a steady path or did they miscalculate? 
Damn!
These new balloons don't just drift. They can control their direction by chasing the most appropriate wind current.
y'all got some explaining to do
What do you think should happen general?  Shoot it down or let it slide?
Did anyone have the brilliant idea of shooting the damn thing down?
So, was it shot down or naw?
how it is possible The distance between the two countries is huge There are three continents and dozens of countries How can a balloon travel so far? Without coming under the eyes and radar of any country
Esto es muy interesante 
OMG!  This was our weather guy in Hsv AL
They can just use TikTok like civilized people
Getting ready to drop that emp over central US I suppose
Why is it still flying?
99 luftballoons
Thanks, Dan!
What are the balloon’s pronouns?
But how did it went pass Japan and Alaska without being noticed? I mean the GMD radars should always targeting in that direction, how did it not intercepted in Alaska.
Like I said.  How did this thing make it over Alaska (where we have military bases) and then Canada (puppets of CCP) decided not to say anything?
Military is too busy going through pronoun training to have caught it.
So this is in controlled air space?
Are we sure it isn't from UA Fairbanks?
It’s a new DJI model
Weather balloons go max 50 mph no chance it came from China yesterday. Also balloons aren’t navigated, very little chance of setting this off in China and it floats around Russia directly to USA.
I mean…. It does resemble a communist sickle.
They don’t need a balloon, they got Swalwell.
While the res on map track is pretty low, it appears to have passed adjacent to the USN underwater acoustic research detachment ID….  Nothing to see here move a long.
Where is this model from?
I see the path you plotted could’ve just as easily started in Alaska where the department of defense has multiple military bases. But our government would never lie LMAO..
Rok dangerous cultures process hide Laudering Rok bussiness fort spys  group infiltrated to the situation. Reports
“It’s not a balloon - IT’S AN AIRSHIP!!” #montypython
here's a nice diagram of the trajectory of the balloon that the NYT article described
Maybe they’re looking for classified documents?
That spy balloon its started from Xinjiang ...
Nothing new under the Sun.  "The program officially commenced on January 10, 1956, with eight launches from Incirlik, Turkey, and one from Giebelstadt, West Germany. Wave after wave followed... quickly racking up some 448 successful launches."
Reminds me of the World War II Japanese balloon bombs
Lots of spying to do in…Montana.
Yellowstone season 6 leaked
Fine and dandy to backtrack the ballon to China but until one gets an actual look at it one can’t say for sure. I’m more inclined to believe it’s the gift from North Korea.
And we are supposed to believe the DOD would rather tell people about it than eliminate it.  Not likely, imo   I may of been born in the morning but not this morning 
Blame everything on china 
Is this 1950  ?!? Have they heard of satellites or any new technology ?
Would this flight during the day on Tuesday in southern BC match the timeline?
Weird thing is, I'am Canadian, and that mean it went thru all Canada without any alert.. I guess anyone can fly over us
Seeing it described as a balloon in most headlines makes it sound simple, even non threatening, til you find out it's the size of 3 school buses.  How was something that size undetected in AK?
They trackin' moose or wolves or somethin'?
How respectful to not fly over Russia but anywhere else they didn’t care
We’re they looking for the Dutton ranch?
Not on my bingo card 
you probably already saw this?
Montana is top secret state. 
Montana??
First photo from the CIA
Why wasn't it spotted until now
Where will it be spotted next?
Ty for posting this
Weird... it looked like the moon, to me... you can see it during the day, and quite often, too...
Bravo  sir. Much appreciated.
That sure looks like Pilot George Santos at the controls hahaha
Why not just tow it in? Or pop it?
They must be looking for the second half of Yellowstone Season 5.
Oh thank you, I was wondering how they know it is from China!
Altitude?
Shoot it down.
Hoping our missile defense systems are better than this would suggest
Shouldn’t we be talking more about how a country got caught spying by a lady with a smart phone and some time to kill?
How high is high? Too high to be shot down?
So it’s ok for the US to spy on other countries but the moment another does it’s bad? The US are the bullies of the western world
Oh, a weather baloon.
What is its current altitude?
If only there was some open space somewhere in Alaska to shoot it down 
Blame “Yellowstone”
Shouldn’t there be some kind of margin of error shown there?
How is a balloon controlled?
Went over Japan, Alaska, a huge  swath of Canada and now into the US and nobody has taken it out?  Unbelievable.
So the big question in my head is, WHERE IS IT NOW if it was in Montana yesterday?
There sure are a lot of people who think the government didn't know before it was announced.
How do we know it's Chinese? Does it have a tag? 
I just hear for all the armchair spy technology experts chiming in. The knowledge here is incredible!
Flat earth
Diabolical!  A balloon flying randomly in accordance to weather patterns.
Sure looks like the earth is flat
Why are they flying over Montana?
Nice work! Maybe it’s a message about US Balloon program …
Nice to see Canada was on top of this. 
I am sure I saw it. I posted on January 20th on my FB that I saw something over the mountain by Portland that hovered in the same place for over 30-40 minutes that I saw...Lots of plane activity flying towards it coming from all sides.
Wow! Right through Alaska &amp; British Columbia too!
Plot twist: it originated in Alaska and is being used to prime the American public for war with China. #WWIII #ConspiracyTheories
A thought on termination. Launch counter-balloon, taking into account the wind profile, to closely approach the balloon. Above the balloon, launch Styrofoam gliding darts by compressed air. Darts glide downward at high speed and puncture balloon. Combat in near space, cool.
Need to send it back... With a Jar of tasty American bee made honey with a letter saying if you wanted some honey you could just ask, Xinni the Pooh.
How do you think China would react if the US flew a Spy Balloon even close to their airspace!?!
What does the satellite image of the point in Central China look like? Is there a balloon base there?
All that empty Alaska and B.C.and they let it get to the lower 48. Ridiculous.
Trump's White House didn't tell us about Chinese surveillance balloons over the United States during his term?????
It flew down British Columbia (aka Chinada).  Someone  has been bought and paid for.
Sounds like "Saddam had weapons of mass destruction" part deux all over.
More like one of Pentagon's balloons
Isn’t there currently one flying over Memphis?
Interesting yet USG cannot identify 62% of UFOs  reported by their own armed personals. Is it fair to say USG has lost the battle with China and rest of Asian countries should start aligning with China
So why would the Chinese fly a weather balloon to Montana? Are there satellites not working?
Can share a bit about how method you used works?
Thank you for sharing!
Did japan not detect it first?
So basically Biden gave them the go ahead
Where is it now
Flew right over Canada.
What if it’s a delivery system? And why didn’t airport’s pick it up earlier?
Everything old is new again
North-Korea would be an option, too?
US spend billions on defence and the Chinese can fly a spy balloon with impunity over the US says it all…
ha ha ha
How did you deduce that the origin was in China, not Japan, Alaska, Canada, or someplace that it was before passing through China? You even say it was "Central" China? Based on what?
Not *just* central China, Lop Nor.
I can’t even keep a party balloon up that long. I hope they didn’t get any top secret family recipes along the way
So what is the US Military going to do about it?
What does China say about it?
There is something very wrong beyond the fact that this thing is parked over MT (how is even able to stay stationary?) 1. It either escaped detection or 2. It was detected and a decision was made not to bring it down over an empty part of AK or CN…
Lol! Not enough tik tok users in Montana or what?
Did we shot it down?
Yep, Meteorologists can't correctly predict the weather but sure can trace a balloon thousands of miles...back in time.
is so weak
Carrington chemicals
How does a ballon navigate with any degree of accuracy?
Nice! Where is this model accessible?
By the way it avoided land until it snuck dead center inland off Alaska says this thing is being "driven". Drone balloon? 
You drew a path around Russia instead of over it...
We must of done the same to them.
Covid cyclone for sure
china are trying to get a better look at missile silos in montana imho, a different pov than satellite images can afford. U.S showing great restraint in not shooting it down. U.S will always be the bigger man and china will always be yappy dogs barking about any small insult!
If you don’t say the C word - it didn’t happen.
if you want to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge---Chinese old  saying
Nicely shown, Dan. Just the facts, ma’am. 
How dare they have weather balloons.
Why not grab it?

How tf did this even get this far into the US without us noticing?
it flew there
conservatives be like: THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HUNTER BIDEN NUDES
I need the source of this I am cackling
Why would they use a “spy balloon”? Don’t they have actual spy satellites?
#Test
Wake up America!! They are here!!
Look like a giant space titty
Probably one of projects
So that why they scrambled those jets. China  is testing our defenses
You can't really control where a balloon blows. I wonder how many spy cameras are hovering over China that are owned and operated by the United States?
At least paint it sky blue… smfh
You mean satellites that are being kept up with balloons
Relax, it’s just mapping all the property they have purchased.
We’re Americans, grab a 22 and make that mf ground level
this woulda been a confirmed UFO sighting 70 years ago
Canada is being pretty quiet about this, especially since it flew over their country and is close to their border...
Canada is pretty quiet about everything
Canada will probably apologise on behalf of china too
Shoot it
They both want this war
So the balloon is connected to a satellite? Also why isn’t it shot down yet?
Balloon made in China ?
What’s it spying?
They gettin to comfortable. Blow that shit up!!!

Nice lmao
3 Refuling planes in the area. So probably alot of fighter jets as well
Why hasn’t it been taken down I don’t get it
Kkkkkkkk  São só satélites!!!!
America doing what it does best, WHICH IS LYING 
Largest canadian military training ground is about 100 miles north of montana 
How do they know that this ballon is from china? Like is there a brand with made in china?
Is it 1945?
USA lol
Why Montana tho
 Take em to the train station.
Nice try, but you can't fool us
Its fine they probably only got a view of like 3 cows and a redneck
They're trying to find Victoria's Secret
Just smile and wave yall.
Blowing this thing out of the sky is the kind of thing that could bring this country together! #leterip
Captured on tiktok?
Trying to get that season 6 Yellowstone preview
Where is our military???!!!
It’s literally Montana. What are they spying on? The American Bison population? Looking for spoilers of a new season of Yellowstone?
Nah that’s from my friend Gary
How they found it’s Chinese? . . . . Well it says “Made in China”!
How the f they know it’s chinese? Is it written made in China or something?
How do they know if  its Chinese, does it say made in China on it..
Why you so obsessed over a balloon?
Espionage on another level!
Fixed it. 
Explain in nfl terms
Y’all know that’s how NASA launches satellites right?
Source: Trust me bro
How do they know it’s Chinese?
Is it possible for these balloons to carry nuclear bombs?
Uhhh, why would we not shoot it down?
That looks like the international space station, clear that target before engaging....
Hunter escape pod.
Lots of icbm silos in Montana. Maybe that?
why is it still flying?
Ban TikTok
Blow it up in the air
Where did they launch it from?  
Cant they just pop it??
bart simpson can sling shot it down
Lol. Trying to figure out the start of the Salmon fly hatch.
Sounds like China needs some freedom
Many will say pop that balloon out of the sky! while the US would choose to keep tabs on it for counterintelligence signal ops.
Apparently for the last few days??   What all is h a p p e n I n g 
Real stealthy!
There’s hardly anybody in Montana - shooting it down seems like a reasonable risk to take.
The landlord just checking over things
oh no, Montana's secrets
Am I the only one who thinks that's just a model ISS attached to a weather balloon?
What's American Air Defense doin'?
"good work Boss"
Quick, everyone! Flip it the bird!!!
DEPLOY JEWISH SPACE LASERS!
I forgot Montana was even a place
Just saw two jets fly over lake tahoe
Looks a lot like balloon that flew over Japan in 2020.
Good for them. How many of those, paid for by the U.S. taxpayers, are spying on the Chinese provinces?
Good!
"Chinese Spy Balloon"
Is that ISS in front of it? If it is, that white sphere object be 10 miles wide 
It’s a guess that it’s spying.
I know who should take it out!
And we down shoot it down because….
Might be checking on their farm land
Pop it
Ya! Because there’s top secret shit going on in Montana. 
Serious stuff, seriously!
Destroy it.  Now.
Montana? Bring it over Jersey. We will take care of business.
Why does this look like the space station crossing the moon?
Hey they have some of our solar panels on it. Well thank you for that. Spying and saving the world at the same time.
That’s wild! Saw that yesterday a couple miles from work and thought it was one of the balloons flying away from a car dealership 
We are not alone. We have never been alone
Xiaomi balloon
Just pop it 
Why does it look like the ISS passing over the moon
Guess what's in Montana anyone anyone
"Hey, look that's the barn where Letterman retired all his Late Show toupees." #OverheardInsideSpyBalloonsTranslations
Rip Wheeler won't let this happen in Montana....
Balloons go off course and crash all the time. If this one "accidentally" blew out over the ocean and fell who's the blame? That happened at Roswell, didn't it!!
Y'all, that's not a balloon. It's the moon!
The greatest Trojan Horse ever, but a ping pong ball rather than a horse.
what the?
Now you post a pic?
They ran out of jet/rocket fuel?
Bro this is no ok
oh no this is the battle of los angeles all over again
Why wait if you know that it violates the sovereignty
Not all balloons are Chinese.
I didn’t see the Five-Star Red flag.
Fly a jet through it.
How many of those are floating around the US?
They're gaslighting you America. This balloon is yours.
Just throw like a sheet over it so it can’t see
Seriously?
A lot to spy in Montana
It came from within our country, follow the money, read the deeds. Chinese have been buying land in the northern states the past 2 years.
How you know is Chinese ?
Spy balloon 
ridiculous
Why is this not destroyed?
By gawd that’s Falcon’s music!
Look everyone. Isn't this the same balloon that appeared in Japan in 2020?
Incredible hi-res picture!
Americans showing off their geography knowledge in the replies.
Over Montana now then where to next. Probably dropping that new variant.
Jajajajajaja!!!
No way it makes it out of Montana.  It’s probably already been shot down by a rancher.
Why didn't they blow it out the sky?
Do you suppose the Chinese government is trying to send a message?  Doesn’t this make us look weak and vulnerable?
Did the residents of Montana say "This is all Chinese to me"
look like flying dutchman
False flag so US citizens go along with warmongering. So obvious.
If you live near a Chinese Embassy or Consulate, it is your JOB to BURN A CHINESE FLAG IN FRONT OF IT.
China rn  they think they slick
This thread is hilarious...
Iss passado pela lua

Sniper it down
who cares about this crap
They spying on our bison farms?
Irrelevant. They can just rent a plane and fly anytime. It’s not quite like North Korea here folks
Made in China Assembled in USA,  Designed in Montana ?!?  What the hack is that up there
Ajajajajaja  como saben que es chino?
Maybe they just wanted to take nice pictures of the mountains?
It's a false flag so that the "world community" can attack China
A large spy balloon from #China has been surveilling the US but will not be shot down due to the safety of civilians say Pentagon officials.
Doesn't every civilian in Montana own lots of guns? Surprised it's not been taken care of yet..
Too high of an altitude.
Ok, poke a small hole.
Coordinates? For God, Country, Family.. I will show it my ass
this would be a perfect use of the Jewish space lasers.
There’s civilians in the balloon?
Sponsored by TikTok on the side of it.
Good Chinese Test
Interesting...
I’m sure l most people underneath it would be willing to sign a waiver
I was just reading about this. How scary. What are they up to
It’s not the first time.
The spy ballon being surveilled, crazy how ironic life is
? Chinese satellites not working?
Fu-Go?
Are we unable to do anything? Like hold up mean statements written in Chinese? ‘You suck st spying!’
Hello Tiktok
Oh boy.  as if my day couldn't get worse.
It's a fucking balloon, they'll be alright.
Is it really a spy balloon if everyone knows about it?
I thought that was 5 G that spies on usdidn’t Trump give them everything top secret already 
TikTok balloon
It’s time , this has been coming to a head for years and will only get worse . Ww3 is a self fulfilling prophecy that people have not only expected but are making it happen .
Wait until you hear what the  consulate in Toronto has been up to...  #cdnpoli
Let me shoot it down.
Are you telling me with a 50 million dollar a day budget, the military can’t shoot down a ballon? We could be attacked by a fleet of hot air balloons. Damn!
I hope it lands in my backyard.
People in Montana are going to start shooting rifles into the air.
I was thinking a couple of Airborne rangers could jump out of plane and land on top of the big pillow. Poke a few holes in it letting out the gas and guide it safely to land. Or toss a bunch of cats right on top of it.
Civilians in Montana.... more cows than people.
Since when does the Pentagon care about civilians' safety?
Tail hook it
Ehh they’d really be starting WW3 if they did that
笑死我了，CIA监控全世界怎么没说
The Pentagon is compromised
SpaceY ?
Could they fear a possible chemical or biological agent on it? Pop the balloon and infect/poison the population? I bet the military can do a halo jump and bring the balloon down without popping it.
Funny thing is, no one knew until it got spotted.....it's a balloon lmao
What if the spy balloon is just the transmitter to for the mind control chips that were installed in everyone who got a COVID vaccine??
There's no threat! It came through Canada a couple of days ago. U.S. government had determined the balloon does not pose a threat.
It's. A. Balloon.  How hard is it?
How many civilians are in Montana anyway. Just tell people to hunker down for a few minutes  and shoot it
How about evacuate the area and then demand it to land or else? I mean are we just gonna do nothing?????? The fuq?
They should shoot it down!
No need to shoot it down. We can gain more intelligence on what they are using and their interests. We know what we have and probably it’s even good they know a bit so they think twice before doing anything stupid.
Lol blow up fucking balloon spy no? What are ya looking at it .... ? Oh wait why worry ahhh fuck around and find out ...?
The question is why was it not shot down before reaching USA? #spyballoon #polqc
Good to know they’ll let spies in the country to keep citizens safe… WAIT WTF—NEVER HEARD OF EVACUATION… Wow the incompetence is stunning…
Someone's gonna shoot it down eventually.
Oh puhleeze if they cared about our safety they wotluld have grown a spine by now.
Civilians? Isn’t it right over a nuclear launch site? Maybe shoot it down and risk it??
The balloon
Cowards
I not buying that story. Lots of wide open spaces with little to no chance of injuries to civilians.
I'm highly skeptical. Why send a balloon - all the way from China? Why not just use a satellite or private planes? Or drones? A balloon from China makes no sense.
BREAKING: Pentagon says China sent spy balloon over Montana, home to one of the most sensitive U.S. military installations, which oversees Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles to gather intelligence, days before Blinken’s Beijing trip.  Your reaction.
They are testing our Balls!
It makes no sense to you because you don't understand military technology. We use spy balloons ourselves. They can hover with relative low energy requirement for long period at extremely high altitude in the same spot.
Blinken should cancel his trip to Beijing until there is a public and verifiable acknowledgment and explanation from Xi.
They're VERY hard to spot. Invisible to radar, and require virtually no energy to operate for long periods.  Who knows how long that thing has been there. We are about to be attacked folks.
Maybe because they can
Balloons cannot be steered. For this reason, surveillance balloons are tethered. If this is a Chinese spy balloon it was launched from US soil.   This is a false flag op.
Maybe China asked permission and got it? Maybe this more FEAR mongering
China has no ingenuity without foreign assistance, maybe it’s the best they can do
Inside job!
People like you are the reason the Chinese are allowed to get away with this shit.
Oh, please expound upon the "people like you" part. I'm dying to hear you explain yourself.
Agree. It makes no sense. It looks like a weather balloon. Sounds like the Pentagon overreacted by scrambling their fighter jets and are now trying to save face. If it was a threat, they would have shot it down, not turned around and gone home.
说的很对，对于一个把洗衣粉当作大型杀伤武器的国家来说，这很正常。但是我认为敏感的警惕性是好的。
Well it worked! It’s not being shot down! And it’s over the heart of where our ballistic missile program is! Why isn’t Biden shooting it out of the sky?
Maybe the ballon has something in it that CCP wants to decimate. They already send fentanyl to kill up to over 100k Americans a year.
IKR? Why not just pay Hunter to contract a domestic drone operator to get whatever aerial pics they want along with documents from the big guy? I dunno, maybe  is more cost effective. Or, the real reason was the optics. 
Because they can use the excuse of, “oh it’s just a weather balloon that strayed off course…” that’s why.
因为那就是一个普通的气象观测用的气球，真有威胁拿下来拆开看呗
Maybe, but I’ve read reports of it happening recently. Chinese? Them or Norks probably.
Now we have murder balloons floating over the US from China...
What's a murder balloon?
Murder balloons 
...as Japan actually did in WW2. Must be the trade winds.
Hopefully the spy balloon from China over Montana can safely be dealt with.  Good hunting!
🚨NEW: A massive spy balloon from China has been surveilling the United States. It is described as the size of three buses and includes a technology bay - ABC
They followed the string from the China spy balloon and it was tied to Swallwell’s chimney…
just because it says made in China doesn't mean it's a spy balloon from China
You better start preparing. You better start training.  You better stop arguing about gender identity, racism, or the next hot topic to divide us is. Either start learning Mandarin Chinese or put down your phones and start getting ready for what is coming.
China claimed the balloon was theirs
A spy balloon sounds like something from the 50s. Why would China send a spy balloon into US air space when they have advanced Satellites?
Official Statement from Hayden Ferguson:  “China sent a "Spy Balloon" over U.S. military sites. Perhaps the U.S. should make it "open season" and fully legal for citizens to shoot down any balloons seen in the sky!” https://t.co/q1GwkKHrYA
Let me see one! I’d pop it and drop it!
It's a bit too high up for that. lmfao
⚠️ HAPPENING NOW: US fighter jets tracking spy balloon from China that is over Montana.   There are over 150 nuclear missiles in Montana. https://t.co/xuktZ0dK30
Of course we know its from china lol
Thats a sateloon not a spy balloon. That is a real satellite,which r balloon based,not in space. Facts
You must be the speech writer for Anthony Fauci
Looking at real estate for sale?
Hunter Biden let them launch it from the backyard of Joe's Delaware mansion....
NORAD bested by stolen Chinese WW2 Japanese Balloon bomb technology I will sleep well tonight.
And how many Chinese army divisions in Canada rn?
Just poke it and let the Chinese explain why they needed it there
And ND has some really sensitive areas, too. Even if there is little concern for seeing something, aren't there other dangers, like dropping something?
Planet dim-sum
That the balloon? If so, nice vid.
We will let see what we want them to see. Shhhhhhhh!
Take it out
They know Biden won’t do anything
I hope our jets can keep up.
What are we waiting for shoot it down hello wake up
They don’t need a balloon, they got Swalwell…
Kill it.
CCP laughing at us.
great..now the commies are mapping out targets in north montana.  our “leader” has been in bed since 5pm.
Shoot it down
It’s China or Aliens ?
Pop...
Settle down. The alarmist rhetoric is absurd. The Chinese, as well as the Russians, have spy satellites above our ICBM silos literally 24/7/365.
Launched from one of the farms they bought?
You can Google the maps of the icbms and drive right up to them - lol - its not a secret - come on people get a life
Weather balloon from China. The "Al Gore 1". Just checking emissions.
#ElonMusk   Take this out please
Can’t they just pop their balloon? I see little kids pop balloons all the time! 
Well so much for keeping that secret
We probably sold them some of our airspace
not a spy balloon
what ship is that?
Check the silos!!!!
if its full of their viruses?
Please tell me how a fighter jet tracks a balloon travelling at 10 mph.
They shouldn’t need the expense of a balloon when they can just read your posts for intel
There’s so much our government is hiding from us it’s criminal.
Why fighter, isn't radar picking it up?
It's Uranus.
Why does it always seem like everytime they see something weird they always blame china?? could it be something from cuba, mexico or canada?
Is it spreading covid or something else??? What is it doing up there and why is it allowed???
Um, I think that was supposed to be a secret.
shoot the damn thing down. what's the hold up?
It's not a good idea to shoot it. It's better to glue some weight to it and slowly drop it to the ground.
And who said letting them buy up all the land in the country was a good idea.  We are so comprised by the ccp isnt not even funny
Bullshit
Biden will return it with some documents from his garage. Everyone has to pay the big guy.
Tracking?  In 1960 the Soviets shot down a U-2 with a pilot &amp; nothing came of it;  rightfully so as the USA was in Soviet air space.  Fast forward to 2023, and our government has a sense of trepidition acting appropriately to secure its air space.
quick... someone tell the kid sniffer that the balloon is actually Russian. He'll shoot it down in a heart beat.
So our cell phones ain't being tracked bye china because they make our cellphone and ticktok collects data are you people that blind sided now
If trump was president, he would be pissing on its grounded carcass right now
Why haven't they captured or killed it?
We need to block it's signal take it down but not pop it we have no idea what their plan is or if it's carrying some new virus it's a threat We NEED to Address nothing should be ALLOWED in our air space from them.
Joe biden is a threat to national security
Biden is probably on the phone right now frantically looking for a pair of testicles.
Now we see what all the Chinese money given to the Bidens was for. Free access to America/Americans..
Why track it? Shoot it down and summon the Chinese ambassador to the White House. Oh fuck, wait, never mind.
Why are we not shooting it down? Does Joe not want to offend his boss Xi?
And it is very near our military installation where we believe there are silos and the Chinese CCP have acquired large plots of land...  Well and the
Shoot that s*** down don't take no chances
Shoot that shit Down don't take no  chances
Someone shoot it down
The Duttons can’t ever relax smh
If it is violating US airspace, then shoot it down.
It was lunched from China? It Flying over the Ocean. It Entered U.S. Air space. And It was spotted over Montana?  It seems like Gulf of Tonkin Incident 2.0 to provoke China
你们这群美国政府的宣传媒体，把美国人洗成脑残了
Boom..should have been this report
Let’s wait till it gathers all the info it needs before shooting it down. Great job American military commanders!
Maybe loaded with covid virus  think twice before burst it!
It’s in US air space, blow it to hell,out of the sky!
who believes this shit, spearhead technology as if it were ww2, it is a meteorological balloon and they want to instill fear
If that was over Russia it would have been shot down the moment it was discovered. But we spend thousands of dollars trying to figure out what to do.
so this Chinese balloon is hovering over Montana a state that has most nuclear development and China is saying it's only a weather balloon. Does anyone else find it odd, not New Mexico, New York, Utah but a state with a major nuclear reputation.
A suspected Chinese surveillance balloon has been observed moving into Montana air space after traveling for several days across northern states.  In Other News: Advanced Military Weapons Deployed -
Fighter jets? 3 KC 135s... 
Reporter: China is buying up land near U.S. military bases. Is this on the administration’s radar?   Co-Press Secretary John Kirby: That’s “a little out of my swim lane.”   Reporter: “This is a national security issue.”   Kirby: “I’m not the right person to ask about this.”
I'm pretty sure if President Trump was still in office either they wouldn't attempt anything like this or President Trump would have shot  that sumbitch out of the ski
Here we go. Let's see who's going to be stupid enough to believe China has sent a "spying balloon" to US territory.   Oh, wait, these are Americans; they believe pretty much anything.  All you have to do is repeated often enough. (Maduro,  Castro, WMDs, Kadafy, Homosexuality).
Could the Chinese balloon possibly be a vessel containing GERM WARFARE, like a Trojan Horse? (Balloon may be releasing germ warfare?).
There are pictures of a SPY BALLOON from CHINA hovering over Montana . . . We wouldn't have a SPY BALLOON from CHINA if TRUMP was in office.
China is dropping a cord from their balloon and I'm clipping it to my belt and riding the balloon back to China.
Enjoy boiling your drinking water
DEVELOPING: A spy balloon from China has been surveilling the U.S., says senior U.S. official. https://t.co/gNDQluCfU7
"Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration," according to senior defense official.
How does this affect Mike Trout’s legacy?
Hey you have any maps
I'd be a bit more worried about their dozens of spy satellites than a single balloon.
A "spy balloon" has made it all the way over here from China and its still in the air surveilling?!?!
I have a suggestion.
Have the Chinese not heard of satellites? Much more secretive 
How did they think they would hide this
Another story said this is a common occurrence and the only difference is how long it has stayed.
Pop it!
Should be easily resolved, no?
Probably laughing at us
Is the balloon TikTok  ?
Whoa whoa whoa they already have TikTok they don’t have to go zeppelin on us
Cover story for a ufo I bet...
Shoot it 
They need to send somebody up there to see if they can shake the spy out
Jimmy Carter’s America smh
may be a weather ballon
Not to mention all the surveillance devices in every copy of The Palmer Hotel, a collection of spooky short stories set over a century at a downtown hotel.  ($15, Venmo: Rick-Paulas, PayPal: Include address)
Shot it down!!!
Yet everything is made in China.
Ain’t nothing spy about a 3 school bus sized balloon.
This is what we've waited for  This is it, boys, this is war The President is on the line  As 99 red balloons go by
Red Zeppelin
Be curious if it's over northern united states but what about Canada too unless Alaska...
Pop it
Ok but to be fair. What is a balloon surveilling that isn’t already online on display.
It’s true and they just got more information on the Chinese spy balloon
Oh the humanity !
may i see it
Knew that bootlegged copy of  UP would come back to haunt us
Biden is taking care of it. God bless
How many spy satellites does each country have pointed at each other? Come on now.
easy fix just poke it
oh wow i certainly hope we haven’t also been spying on china, that would really make it hard for us to complain and be taken seriously
sorry, that was mine. i wanted to get a better view of the U.S. collapsing
Kinda doubt they need a balloon to spy when each country has 5000 spy satellites pointed at each other
remind me of the evidence that it's from China, or are we just taking the word of the intelligence community again.
Probably checking to see if all the junk we buy from them is working out.
Bidens America
It’s a weather ballon it’s Superman in the sky great work on the defense system we have way to go guys keep napping 
Prepping us for alien invasion… remember this tweet 
I saw it !!
Lmaooooooo. I’m sorry. But that is a tad funny
Is it flying over "Mar A Largo"..
Shoot it.
Wow wonder what they're looking at? I just use Google Maps to look at stuff!
But yet we are a secure country
Be nice if we didn’t have a President who is beholden to China about now
I’ll handle it
Better dump another three trillion in defense to beat this balloon technology
How about looking here as well
We need to ask questions.. multiple videos show a "hovering" ufo.. Chinese are that advanced with balloons  that can hover in one place with all that wind that high?
The spy balloon 
we are weak
It’s prob a weather balloon lmao
I wonder how many US balloons are over China
sewed into said balloon
Anyone hear from yet?
Could this explain the recent “ufo” sightings?
Y’all got google map or no
It may have the capability to drop and then glide small shoebox sized drone gliders.
By the way - and were caught cheating on their spouses and a banding their children by having an affair but there is no information of any kind relating to their firing on your websites so what kind of fair and unbalanced news agency are you?
If only our 817 billion dollar defense budget could handle a balloon.
Go figure hmm 
What?
$817 Billion and nobody at the Pentagon has one of these
So you are telling me that you cant find a safe place to shoot this down in Montana?   You cant find one single safe open space with no people in Montana?   No part of me can believe that one bit.
Bring it down.  They won't think twice about doing it to us!! Stop them from buying our land it's not allowed...grow a pair
how dare they do to us what we do to them?
Holy shit, here's what it looks like
Why do they need spy balloons when they have TikTok?
Chinese spy balloon has been spotted over the US in past years, but pose no threat?   None that they're able to identified yet.  By the time they do, it's too waiting for a breach to be discovered?
How do they know it is from China, has anyone visited the baloon and confirmed it.  Seems like the European war is not enough..
Delivering Hunter's next payment.
Could this be it? I took this near Saint Paul, MN so I’m not sure if it’s even possible to see it this far away if it’s over Montana but it sure looks like the other videos I’ve seen.
What kind of communications does it use? RF? LoRa? Inquiring minds need to know!
We should send a Godzilla robot over there
mr. joe biden must nuke shanghai
DEVELOPING: so do we who cares
Another Pearl Harbor?
#TenPercentForTheBigGuy
What would be the reasons China did this? One could be to make us aware they are spying on all of us already? They knew we would see it. There could be alot of reasons they did this.
China: -1 Chinese Spy Balloon. US: +1 Chinese Spy Balloon.
I knew them blimps look suspicious!
Quite the snooper, aren’t ya…
Maybe can phone in a favor to Fang Fang to get it the hell out of here.
My first reaction to this tweet was, “OMG they are covering actual news”
How do they know it is for surveillance and not some other nefarious thing, like, say, dropping something?  I get the concern, but this thing is in our airspace and is unmanned.
Has China made any agricultural purchases?
Surely there is a safe way to capture the balloon and its technology?
Why do they need a balloon when everyone is on TikTok?
Using a balloon instead of satellites......is this a sign of inflation in China?
Not surprising considering todays military is more concerned with diversity than they are with qualifications.
How much money is in the defense budget for slingshots?
I always thought MSM strived to be accurate.  This is no balloon:
Here’s some breaking news ABC. Are you aware that a Republican Congress woman of New Jersey was MURDERED yesterday? Maybe do a story on that instead of your continual focus on Santos.
What's the "spy balloon" name, Tick tock or insert any other social media name or search engines and also is this "spy balloon" powered by steam
It’s a stray weather balloon pushed off course by a bird fart.
If they really want to see how it’s going they can just create an account on Nextdoor.
Xi wanted to visit.
Was Fang, Fang, flying in it?
Just cover it with a large plastic bag...
Are they going to say that it's a Balloon?
okay. So what?
Oh look!  It's Xi!
Take it out.
How did it get here and how long has it been here. How many have we had so for?  Did Scottie beam it in?
Instead of talking about it, do something about it.
This should not be happening.
It's not really a spy balloon when everyone knows it's a spy balloon 
The bigger question is what are they dropping along the way ! Wait soon it wb another virus !!!
Why is this news? You guys been spying at each other for decades now.
Let that thing come over my house and it'll be laying in the back 40
They are just "Peking" at us.
This may all be due to inflation.
It’s triangulating with everyone’s TicToc app!!!  QUICK EVERYONE DELETE IT NOW!!
Cool.
China is buying a lot of land I can see why They want to buy more and live here I'm just guessing
Hey China,
Army officials:&nbsp;military installations are a no-fly zone for unauthorized drones.  But it is fine for CHINA TO DO IT!
Can we just take it out?
Meanwhile, in China:
go up there hook on to it..... and tow it back to earth....then send them an invitation to come pick it up
This is what the China balloon looks like.
Shhh... they think it's a satellite.  You'll hurt their feelings!
He's not spying.  He's trying to get to the honey.
Don't care
This is ridiculous
How the F that happens in Montana?
It’s aliens not the Chinese
I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump and family hid them and provide blind spots and methods to do it
Why don't we just blow it up
This is not a surprise what is how long it took you to realize it.  What about them tracking aircraft carriers in the pacific?!
The balloons are on the ground...divide and conquer...
Probably making plans for the land they might ask for to pay off the debt they have over us
Are we really surprised by this?! C'mon now.  They own huge amounts of our land too...how bout putting a stop to it! And maybe stop using all their tech on our communications systems...just a thought
LeSpyballoon
The US Air Force will probably tell us it is just a silly weather balloon. 
A balloon? What is this 1935? China has Satellites and they go with a balloon?
Seems appropriate
I can’t believe we haven’t popped that thing yet…this administration is unbelievable TAKE IT DOWN!
Keep spying. It's fine. Biden is ok with it
I thought that's what they were "using" tiktok for 
It’s market equities spying on the Yellowstone Ranch.
yep it's an alien.. you don't let a balloon just make it all the way here and then scrabble jets
They thought they were clever trying to make it look like the moon.
Well since Bidens documents are being found all over the place.. He now is just holding up the documents outside the window for the balloon 
Shocker
Balloon boy rides again!
Was it TikTok?
Just another day of damage done to our country due to Donald Trump's failed policies.
I do not believe it, because the government since the Trump administration has done so many racist things against China, our government could be telling the truth and I would never believe it.
This is embarrassing!
How has this not been destroyed yet?  What the heck..
So had a giant social media app…so nothing new. Thanks for the update, Sherlock!
should we shoot it down
Ohhhhh. U mean all them UFO’s people been claiming to see
Ya ya he sell that balloon at dollar store
It used to be so easy for Beijing to get the money and crack to Hunter Biden.. now look what they have to resort to.
Shoot it down
🚨BREAKING: A massive spy balloon from China has been surveilling the United States. It is described as the size of three buses and includes a technology bay. Pentagon says not safe to shoot it down - AP/ABC https://t.co/99fmyDdxgM
Where?
Not safe to shoot it down?
Where does it say made in China? It's going to be very embarrassing when that is not the fact..
Shoot it down so I can see it. Right now all I see is a bright dot.
USA on movies: We can detect a nuclear missile anywhere on the globe from the moment they were fired. USA in reality: *China could have dropped a nuclear bomb with a f*cking balloon without detected until it goes very center of the whole country.* https://t.co/l7Wk39VgQD
That’s not the spy balloon.      There is usually one or two of those balloons flying over evey other day.
Usa has satellitels all over the world, has even mapped it street by street, and now they are winning about a stupid globe common man how stupid is that
Crazy! How do you get a giant spy balloon from China to Montana without it showing up somewhere along the way?
The U.S. thinks it's a high-altitude balloon from China that entered domestic airspace a few days ago, according to a senior defense official.
BREAKING: The United States government has detected and is tracking a high altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now that the US government to include NORAD continues to track and monitor it closely, balloon is currently traveling at
an altitude well above commercial air traffic does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground, says Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder.
This is not the first time a surveillance balloon has come into domestic airspace. It is appearing to "hangout for a longer period" than in previous instances, the senior defense official said.
The U.S. will not say the exact altitude, but it is above where civilian air traffic is active, a senior defense official said.
The U.S. has used manned military aircraft, including F-22s, to observe the balloon, a senior defense official said.
In previous instances, Chinese high-altitude balloons did not loiter for long over the continental U.S., a senior defense official said.
I wouldn't characterize the payload on this as "revolutionary," a senior defense official said. What is different is that it is loitering over the U.S. for a prolonged period.
If the U.S. actually cared about Chinese surveillance they would ban tiktok
WTF are they waiting for, shoot it DOWN
#DOD says high altitude balloon over Montana yesterday was a spy balloon from #China. I did a quick run of the #NOAA HYSPLIT model to trace backwards the path of an object. Using 14K meters  over Montana yesterday I get the following - Yup Central China! https://t.co/FHiG79f4th https://t.co/DeZLjjkPei
 the chance of this getting over Alaska unseen are zero.
Truth. It’s just not that big of a deal.
Yeah, China floats a spy balloon over sovereign US airspace and its not thay big of a deal.   Under an admin that took the country and its job of protecting it, this would be an act of war.  Not a big deal.  
Yes, but they change hourly and by altitude.
How could a sizable Chinese spy balloon drifting high in the airspace over our northern plains *not* be considered, at least, a potential safety threat to other aircraft?  Also, I thought spy balloons were considered Rocky and Bullwinkle-ish technology.
It was well above the altitude that airliners fly. If it had fallen into those lanes, I suspect they would have brought it down. That said, dozens of weather balloons are launched twice daily across North America. They rise up to 20 miles and burst. No record of any hits.
they burst? do they carry a giant satellite the size of three city buses? China is technologically advanced enough to have comparable weather equipment, so why was the payload so damn big?
The balloon was the size of three buses. I doubt it carried ore than 50 kg of weight. Much of that solar panels.
So we had a spy balloon fly over Alaska and Montana and we are just now hearing about it?
Seems like we should have known about it before it crossed the whole state of Alaska
You sound like CCP...
They are right on several of these points. The CCP sending this doesn't make alot of sense. It may not be chinese. It may not even have a military purpose.
Much lower ground speed, gathers signals in much longer segments, less atmospheric ablation of signals &amp; photos. Lots of reasons.  Plus satellites are generally well known and predictable path, balloons, not so much.
"balloons not so much" is one of the many reasons this hysteria is so absurd
The only hysteria is from right wingers that want this to be true.
The situation now is that everyone thinks differently. You say there are no such problems. You can talk about your views.
New nickname, China Xi Larry.
Why do you need a spy balloon when you can just use google earth?
** BREAKING ** New photos have emerged from INSIDE the spy balloon... #DOD #ChinaBalloon #NOAA
Heading back home do you think?
Chinese spy balloon over Montana, the United States.   (Source: KSVI-TV) https://t.co/bCI9ODxYDB
F18s are on the way
Why would they use a “spy balloon”? Don’t they have actual spy satellites?
we dumped 42 tons of glitter onto the tarmac of area 51 to see how the federal government responded. will they win 50,000usd reacting in time?
Canada will probably apologise on behalf of china too
Let me guess.... Zero.
I can think of a thousand ways we could have cameras over China but the ones in the atmosphere would get shot down. Unlike our dictator, Xi is not a fool.
Who knows how or why that ballon made it's way here. But the media will say whatever will drive up viewership.
Who knows? Are you joking? Seriously?
bro, thats the iss
The US regularly sails their warships in the South China sea and Taiwan strait. Interesting to see China also do this.
Did they think we weren’t going to see it
I don’t know why the US would allow this. It could be spreading COVID up from above.
Los EEUU buscando enemigos imaginarios parte 5000mil
Us: we have the most powerful military on the world, and the cutting edge technology. Also Us: hahaha look a balloon, probably spying on us. Let's say it's Chinese so we wouldn't feel so embarrassed
At first, I thought I was looking at a scene from Peter Pan
don't they have satellites ?
Great! We urgently need to spy on the rogue nation
They’re more interested in Montana that we are. How long before they start looking for nuclear launch codes in Wyoming?
Doesn’t china own a ton of land around there?
A large spy balloon from #China has been surveilling the US but will not be shot down due to the safety of civilians say Pentagon officials.
It almost seems as if we were living the movie Idiocracy.  Everyone is dumbed down.
SHOOT IT THE FUCK DOWN
So a Chinese "spy balloon" has been floating around the US for days and they just figured out what it was. A massive balloon. All the way from China.  Our air defense must be wonderful. Good thing it wasn't a stealth aircraft and just a giant circus balloon.
all those trillions of dollars for def … mansions in Northern Virginia, LULZ  Birds (F-35s) that don’t fly and duckies (Zumwalts) that don’t float.  And all we get are gamma ray suntans.
Should’ve killed us when they had the chance

Shoot it down
Tracking it. Okay.
Honestly surprised a drone has not messed with it...
I don’t see a big China flag anywhere. The US isn’t above lying to justify aggression against a perceived enemy.
This reply is satire…right?
The US is spying on everyone and now they’re upset that someone is spying on them 
Let me guess, “We will continue to monitor the situation.”
I saw it too. Earlier that day I spotted this in the sky but when I tried to warn my family my internet connection went down. Something fishy going on...
Just about to rain goats
A massive spy balloon from China is flying over the United States right now.  "The US government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is flying over the continental United States right now.” https://t.co/2Ey4ce6BL5
It was just confirmed that the Chinese government currently has a spy balloon flying over the US which shut down the air space over Billings yesterday. This is footage from our reporter Travia outside the NBC studios of the ballon. (1/2)
Let it fly over my house! 
What if it’s full of a virus??
Zooming in, we see the pilots:
this is a phenomenal response
It’s called Tik Tok 
I saw this in Command and Conquer Red Alert 2
Wait. So it landed and took off again?
It’s ok, nothing to worry about.
Could the balloon actually be Hayabusa the falcon?
Spotted slowly floating over the northern United States is a balloon, reportedly from China.  Maybe it's there to promote a new takeout restaurant chain called 'One Hung Low'. #Chineseballoon #ChineseNewYear https://t.co/vjo06KDRNS
Breaking news: The Pentagon says it's tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that's been over the U.S. for the past couple days. A senior defense official says there's 'high confidence' it's from China. U.S. officials discussed whether it should be shot down. 1/
The military decided against it because the balloon was not seen as adding significant intelligence value beyond what could already be gleaned from satellites. Also, it was not seen as posing a security threat because it's well above the altitude of commercial aircraft. 2/
The official said it has been tracked since it came over the continental U.S. in recent days. He added that it was over Montana, but did not divulge the current location. 3/end
Shoot it down over the ocean when it crosses into the Atlantic … captured  it … check out gear … turn into burning lamp and send back
DEVELOPING: A massive spy balloon from China is flying over the continental U.S., government officials said Thursday. The Pentagon has reportedly decided not to shoot it down due to risks of harm for people on the ground. #abc15  https://t.co/9e5FFuopJA
Xi is laughing in Biden's face.
They coming!
Omg well fly a drone and spray the cams on the balloon
Oh come on, I’m sure they’ve invented something that would vaporize it! 
It sure would've  been nice to see the spy balloon  and see what we dealing  with , we she'll play with the same card and send a Ballon to
Looking for the good Mexican food spots.
How do they know it’s Chinese? Is there a giant Made in China painted on it or something?
Clearly they had have seen something the size of three buses long before it made its way over the middle of the country. Why not shoot it down long before it makes its way over land? And why are they saying it doesn’t pose a threat?
How does a balloon “linger”.  You can’t shoot a couple holes in it and make it descend slowly ? You couldn’t have detected this before it entered airspace ? Come on?!
The Defense Department is "confident" a balloon spotted over Billings is a surveillance balloon from China, a senior defense official said Thursday. https://t.co/9QgME9D2cn
…Is this like what we did with Russia that one time to start a war…
They’re watching Tester at Hometown Buffet.
They’re looking for the Train Station 
This is a distraction. Do you really believe a Chinspy spy balloon would float around for days without being noticed?  What a Joke!
Why doesn't someone shoot it down!
⚠️ HAPPENING NOW: US fighter jets tracking spy balloon from China that is over Montana.   There are over 150 nuclear missiles in Montana. https://t.co/xuktZ0dK30
#BREAKING A massive spy balloon from China has been surveilling the United States, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday. The balloon is described as the size of three buses and includes a technology bay. https://t.co/95jFRX6Zan
Easy solution 
Just pop it
Just sayin’
Wait,... A 'ground stop' in Billings Montana?  You mean the damn thing came down and we did nothing about it,..??
Balloon, huh?
Show us the balloon.
Propaganda i say
China is dropping a cord from their balloon and I'm clipping it to my belt and riding the balloon back to China.
#US tracking large #Chinese spy balloon flying across country, officials say  The balloon doesn't create significant value added to what China can collect through low-orbit satellites.  The balloon is large enough to cause damage from debris if shot down. https://t.co/oHVps10PK1
DEVELOPING: A spy balloon from China has been surveilling the U.S., says senior U.S. official. https://t.co/gNDQluCfU7
China is sending him talking points from their communication balloon. China wants the USA to have tribal wars.
Hey MAGA-GOP— take a look in your own damn mirror before you come here looking for Anti-Semitism.
This “Surveillance balloon from China” story smells like a CIA psyop.
Pretty much everything is a CIA psyop now.  I mean, literally everything. Seriously.
Could the opening of the USA ’s 1000 foreign military base, which now means they encircle China have any bearing? Let’s see some close up pics.
Modified take on their UFO ops which they've been running since the 1950s.
nailed it. modern day "weapons of mass destruction" gig. so, I should believe a nation like China... doing better economically at home &amp; abroad than USA, but 4 some reason is risking war 2 spy on nothing important. they don't FEAR USA militarily/economically, BUT, USA FEARS THEM.
Big time
Got to be a weather balloon that got away from them
Is this based on your extensive knowledge of CIA psyops?
I haven’t even heard about this but “Balloon” anything sounds like an op immediately lmao
At this point assume everything is and, if it's not, be pleasantly surprised.
China says it's one of their weather balloons that got blown off path on accident
probably CGI and gaslighting the population with more psyop circus.
Life is just one psy-op after another in 21st Century CIA-land.
Yeah, China has high tech satellites, why would they send a balloon? And why didn't anyone or anything see it while it was passing above Alaska? And Canada? Especially considering the issues between the US and Russia atm. Smells like BS for sure
So do you
It's the latest shiny ball and effective because people actually believe that China only uses a big white balloon to spy on us. Incredible if it wasn't so pathetically ignorant.
Apparently derived from a 19th century spy book on how to spook people. I think we should've shot cannonballs at it.
This is pure theatrics, what better way to distract from evidence coming out you are an agent of China than having a china spy balloon to make it seem like an adversarial relationship.   Biden is an agent of china
Biden should shoot down the Chinese spy balloon immediately.  President Trump would have never tolerated this.  President Trump would have never tolerated many things happening to America.
The Pentagon wanted to shoot down China's spy balloon hovering over Montana but "Sleepy Joe" told em "nah it doesn't pose a risk to US security"! What planet are you from moron?? SMH
Can't even compare that giant spy balloon from China to Sputnik
#DOD says high altitude balloon over Montana yesterday was a spy balloon from #China. I did a quick run of the #NOAA HYSPLIT model to trace backwards the path of an object. Using 14K meters  over Montana yesterday I get the following - Yup Central China! https://t.co/FHiG79f4th https://t.co/DeZLjjkPei
This is infuriating.   This thing flew through Alaska and Canada and we are just now noticing it?   Like wtf we have a literal aircraft over the continental us and it's like no big deal
I think it was noticed over Alaska, but does not seem much of a threat. Spy satellites will do a much better job. Can’t really aim a balloon.  Not sure what it’s for, but I cannot see a reason to be alarmed about it.
Can we fly a spy balloon over other countries without them "being alarmed about it"? Maybe over the concentration camps in China? WTH?
How about ....
How could a sizable Chinese spy balloon drifting high in the airspace over our northern plains *not* be considered, at least, a potential safety threat to other aircraft?  Also, I thought spy balloons were considered Rocky and Bullwinkle-ish technology.
It was well above the altitude that airliners fly. If it had fallen into those lanes, I suspect they would have brought it down. That said, dozens of weather balloons are launched twice daily across North America. They rise up to 20 miles and burst. No record of any hits.
they burst? do they carry a giant satellite the size of three city buses? China is technologically advanced enough to have comparable weather equipment, so why was the payload so damn big?
The balloon was the size of three buses. I doubt it carried ore than 50 kg of weight. Much of that solar panels.
I'm curious- have they developed enough control of stratospheric balloons that they could know it would 1) reach the US and 2) hang around?  (It's a balloon not a plane so presumably it will have to drift down at some point we'll have answers then.)
As far as controlling it, there is not much you could do except raise and lower. No way you could aim for a target 5000km away! You could do some partial steering but above 40k ft, the winds are usually going at a good clip. To use to spy, I would think is not at all viable.
Exactly how do we know China isn’t establishing this spy balloon as to front run for a future EMP attack over America, as we did over certain Japanese cities in WWII as a set-up for the atomic bombs?
Lol. For the same reason we aren’t. Physics. SMH
Really useful - many thanks!
So we had a spy balloon fly over Alaska and Montana and we are just now hearing about it?
Holy hell
Seems like we should have known about it before it crossed the whole state of Alaska
If HYSPLIT is right, it went over SKorea, Japan and Canada before Montana. NOBODY kicked up a fuss but now everybody is hysterical because the Pentagon "believes" it's PRC? How does it "spy" if it doesn't emit electronic signals? Why use low tech when PRC has real spy satellites?
You sound like CCP...
They are right on several of these points. The CCP sending this doesn't make alot of sense. It may not be chinese. It may not even have a military purpose.
Did you see this ?
Yes. We’ve been running similar trajectory models.
Yes, this is *backtracking* the course of the balloon, not predicting where it will go in the future. You might also note that the accuracy of this estimate--based largely on data, hey! collected by balloons--is still only good enough to come within a few hundred miles.
Bet they send one over whenever a polar trough digs south.  Also, why wouldn’t the balloon continue to rise and expand, then pop like a NWS balloon?
So we have a 1 trillion defense budget, and that thinf could fly all the way over Alaska and Canada without notice?  They either let it happen   This is a Hollywood story   or the military is lacking somewhere...
Or they didnt "just now" find out. But I'm going with Hollywood story
Even if they didn't find out today. That thing went through Alaska and Canada, like doing some free tour. This could be a hell of a Hollywood story 
I vaguely remember that a couple of balloons from Japan appeared over the US during WWII.
Yes, I believe there was one death from a Japanese balloon in WW2.
Six in Gearhart  Mountain, Oregon in May of 1945.
I think there was an episode about this on or I know I've listened to the story
What's the point of spy balloons when spy satellites exist?
Much lower ground speed, gathers signals in much longer segments, less atmospheric ablation of signals &amp; photos. Lots of reasons.  Plus satellites are generally well known and predictable path, balloons, not so much.
"balloons not so much" is one of the many reasons this hysteria is so absurd
The only hysteria is from right wingers that want this to be true.
We spend way too much on defense.
Twitter provides better service than the DOD evidently.
So now liberals attack republicans for not being pro US?  Liberals are now the old, pro war republicans. Weird times.
wonder why they were in Montana…
There are unmanned silos in Montana.
These are in the same area as the CCP spy balloon
Common sense…you’re looking at the wrong regime for that…
Excellent work.   It might *look* like a spy balloon. It could be carrying an EMP.  Why is the Pentagon "continuing to monitor"?  Where is the Commander in
Civilian Action against the balloon incoming.
doesn't have these problems
The situation now is that everyone thinks differently. You say there are no such problems. You can talk about your views.
Where is the outrage over USA using balloons to spy on China?
New nickname, China Xi Larry.
Recalibrate for flat earth model please, thanks!
It's fascinating that China amazingly found a jet stream that would take this intel balloon exactly over S. Korea, Japan, Alaska, and then swing down to Montana.
At least someone out there can accurately predict the weather.
idk who this is  lol #SacredBlockBadge 𓁿
If I were the White House spokesman last week, I would have prepared the following announcement, BEFORE it entered US airspace.  They were dumb to think this thing would go unnoticed, and not become a PR nightmare.
Interesting. Good work
Is there a way to see likely future trajectory?
#ShootItDown
And our government if that’s what you want to call it didn’t know???? Lmaoooo
Explain this like I’m 5
Knew where it was headed
Are they able to navigate this balloon or is it just drifting?
Well done. Very nice.
Possibly carrying more deadly virus? maybe nano technological weapon? why else would they not shoot it down?
y'all got some explaining to do
Is this a steady path or did they miscalculate? 
Damn!
These new balloons don't just drift. They can control their direction by chasing the most appropriate wind current.
What do you think should happen general?  Shoot it down or let it slide?
Did anyone have the brilliant idea of shooting the damn thing down?
So, was it shot down or naw?
how it is possible The distance between the two countries is huge There are three continents and dozens of countries How can a balloon travel so far? Without coming under the eyes and radar of any country
Esto es muy interesante 
OMG!  This was our weather guy in Hsv AL
They can just use TikTok like civilized people
Getting ready to drop that emp over central US I suppose
Why is it still flying?
99 luftballoons
Thanks, Dan!
What are the balloon’s pronouns?
But how did it went pass Japan and Alaska without being noticed? I mean the GMD radars should always targeting in that direction, how did it not intercepted in Alaska.
Like I said.  How did this thing make it over Alaska (where we have military bases) and then Canada (puppets of CCP) decided not to say anything?
Military is too busy going through pronoun training to have caught it.
So this is in controlled air space?
Are we sure it isn't from UA Fairbanks?
It’s a new DJI model
Weather balloons go max 50 mph no chance it came from China yesterday. Also balloons aren’t navigated, very little chance of setting this off in China and it floats around Russia directly to USA.
I mean…. It does resemble a communist sickle.
They don’t need a balloon, they got Swalwell.
I see the path you plotted could’ve just as easily started in Alaska where the department of defense has multiple military bases. But our government would never lie LMAO..
“It’s not a balloon - IT’S AN AIRSHIP!!” #montypython
here's a nice diagram of the trajectory of the balloon that the NYT article described
Maybe they’re looking for classified documents?
Nothing new under the Sun.  "The program officially commenced on January 10, 1956, with eight launches from Incirlik, Turkey, and one from Giebelstadt, West Germany. Wave after wave followed... quickly racking up some 448 successful launches."
They trackin' moose or wolves or somethin'?
How respectful to not fly over Russia but anywhere else they didn’t care
Reminds me of the World War II Japanese balloon bombs
Yellowstone season 6 leaked
Fine and dandy to backtrack the ballon to China but until one gets an actual look at it one can’t say for sure. I’m more inclined to believe it’s the gift from North Korea.
And we are supposed to believe the DOD would rather tell people about it than eliminate it.  Not likely, imo   I may of been born in the morning but not this morning 
Blame everything on china 
Weird... it looked like the moon, to me... you can see it during the day, and quite often, too...
Is this 1950  ?!? Have they heard of satellites or any new technology ?
That sure looks like Pilot George Santos at the controls hahaha
Would this flight during the day on Tuesday in southern BC match the timeline?
Oh thank you, I was wondering how they know it is from China!
While the res on map track is pretty low, it appears to have passed adjacent to the USN underwater acoustic research detachment ID….  Nothing to see here move a long.
Where is this model from?
Rok dangerous cultures process hide Laudering Rok bussiness fort spys  group infiltrated to the situation. Reports
That spy balloon its started from Xinjiang ...
Altitude?
Shoot it down.
We’re they looking for the Dutton ranch?
Not on my bingo card 
Hoping our missile defense systems are better than this would suggest
you probably already saw this?
Montana is top secret state. 
Montana??
First photo from the CIA
Why wasn't it spotted until now
Where will it be spotted next?
Ty for posting this
Bravo  sir. Much appreciated.
Why not just tow it in? Or pop it?
They must be looking for the second half of Yellowstone Season 5.
How do you think China would react if the US flew a Spy Balloon even close to their airspace!?!
Shouldn’t there be some kind of margin of error shown there?
Can share a bit about how method you used works?
How is a balloon controlled?
Diabolical!  A balloon flying randomly in accordance to weather patterns.
Sure looks like the earth is flat
Weird thing is, I'am Canadian, and that mean it went thru all Canada without any alert.. I guess anyone can fly over us
Went over Japan, Alaska, a huge  swath of Canada and now into the US and nobody has taken it out?  Unbelievable.
So the big question in my head is, WHERE IS IT NOW if it was in Montana yesterday?
Seeing it described as a balloon in most headlines makes it sound simple, even non threatening, til you find out it's the size of 3 school buses.  How was something that size undetected in AK?
Thank you for sharing!
There sure are a lot of people who think the government didn't know before it was announced.
How do we know it's Chinese? Does it have a tag? 
I just hear for all the armchair spy technology experts chiming in. The knowledge here is incredible!
Flat earth
Why are they flying over Montana?
Nice work! Maybe it’s a message about US Balloon program …
Nice to see Canada was on top of this. 
I am sure I saw it. I posted on January 20th on my FB that I saw something over the mountain by Portland that hovered in the same place for over 30-40 minutes that I saw...Lots of plane activity flying towards it coming from all sides.
Plot twist: it originated in Alaska and is being used to prime the American public for war with China. #WWIII #ConspiracyTheories
A thought on termination. Launch counter-balloon, taking into account the wind profile, to closely approach the balloon. Above the balloon, launch Styrofoam gliding darts by compressed air. Darts glide downward at high speed and puncture balloon. Combat in near space, cool.
Need to send it back... With a Jar of tasty American bee made honey with a letter saying if you wanted some honey you could just ask, Xinni the Pooh.
What does the satellite image of the point in Central China look like? Is there a balloon base there?
Sounds like "Saddam had weapons of mass destruction" part deux all over.
More like one of Pentagon's balloons
Shouldn’t we be talking more about how a country got caught spying by a lady with a smart phone and some time to kill?
How high is high? Too high to be shot down?
So it’s ok for the US to spy on other countries but the moment another does it’s bad? The US are the bullies of the western world
Oh, a weather baloon.
What is its current altitude?
If only there was some open space somewhere in Alaska to shoot it down 
Blame “Yellowstone”
So what is the US Military going to do about it?
What does China say about it?
Everything old is new again
Wow! Right through Alaska &amp; British Columbia too!
Did japan not detect it first?
All that empty Alaska and B.C.and they let it get to the lower 48. Ridiculous.
Trump's White House didn't tell us about Chinese surveillance balloons over the United States during his term?????
It flew down British Columbia (aka Chinada).  Someone  has been bought and paid for.
Where is it now
Flew right over Canada.
What if it’s a delivery system? And why didn’t airport’s pick it up earlier?
Isn’t there currently one flying over Memphis?
There is something very wrong beyond the fact that this thing is parked over MT (how is even able to stay stationary?) 1. It either escaped detection or 2. It was detected and a decision was made not to bring it down over an empty part of AK or CN…
Lol! Not enough tik tok users in Montana or what?
Did we shot it down?
Yep, Meteorologists can't correctly predict the weather but sure can trace a balloon thousands of miles...back in time.
is so weak
Carrington chemicals
How does a ballon navigate with any degree of accuracy?
Nice! Where is this model accessible?
So basically Biden gave them the go ahead
By the way it avoided land until it snuck dead center inland off Alaska says this thing is being "driven". Drone balloon? 
Interesting yet USG cannot identify 62% of UFOs  reported by their own armed personals. Is it fair to say USG has lost the battle with China and rest of Asian countries should start aligning with China
US spend billions on defence and the Chinese can fly a spy balloon with impunity over the US says it all…
How did you deduce that the origin was in China, not Japan, Alaska, Canada, or someplace that it was before passing through China? You even say it was "Central" China? Based on what?
** BREAKING ** New photos have emerged from INSIDE the spy balloon... #DOD #ChinaBalloon #NOAA
Instead of just taking it down like a normal person, let's wring this balloon story for whatever credibility is left 
Nice! Although presumably you chose a 120 hour backward simulation. Since its initial ascent is not controlled by large-scale resolved flow, I guess it is hard to pin-point a launch location. i.e. the trajectory is still at ~ 100hPa over China (and Japan, and Canada).
My guess is concerns over payload. The Pentagon has multiple balloon projects with the intent of carrying various payload and having way more sophisticated sensor tech than satellites.
How did Alaska or Canada not spot this thing first?
Unmmm  Canada, looks like you missed the spy blimp that traveled over the west coast….. whose job is it to notice spy  ships #Canada #politics
You drew a path around Russia instead of over it...
We must of done the same to them.
Covid cyclone for sure
So why would the Chinese fly a weather balloon to Montana? Are there satellites not working?
North-Korea would be an option, too?
china are trying to get a better look at missile silos in montana imho, a different pov than satellite images can afford. U.S showing great restraint in not shooting it down. U.S will always be the bigger man and china will always be yappy dogs barking about any small insult!
If you don’t say the C word - it didn’t happen.
if you want to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge---Chinese old  saying
A large spy balloon from #China has been surveilling the US but will not be shot down due to the safety of civilians say Pentagon officials.
Doesn't every civilian in Montana own lots of guns? Surprised it's not been taken care of yet..
Too high of an altitude.
Ok, poke a small hole.
Coordinates? For God, Country, Family.. I will show it my ass
this would be a perfect use of the Jewish space lasers.
There’s civilians in the balloon?
Sponsored by TikTok on the side of it.
Good Chinese Test
I’m sure l most people underneath it would be willing to sign a waiver
Interesting...
I was just reading about this. How scary. What are they up to
It’s not the first time.
The spy ballon being surveilled, crazy how ironic life is
? Chinese satellites not working?
Fu-Go?
Are we unable to do anything? Like hold up mean statements written in Chinese? ‘You suck st spying!’
Hello Tiktok
Oh boy.  as if my day couldn't get worse.
It's a fucking balloon, they'll be alright.
Is it really a spy balloon if everyone knows about it?
I thought that was 5 G that spies on usdidn’t Trump give them everything top secret already 
TikTok balloon
It’s time , this has been coming to a head for years and will only get worse . Ww3 is a self fulfilling prophecy that people have not only expected but are making it happen .
Wait until you hear what the  consulate in Toronto has been up to...  #cdnpoli
Let me shoot it down.
Are you telling me with a 50 million dollar a day budget, the military can’t shoot down a ballon? We could be attacked by a fleet of hot air balloons. Damn!
I hope it lands in my backyard.
People in Montana are going to start shooting rifles into the air.
I was thinking a couple of Airborne rangers could jump out of plane and land on top of the big pillow. Poke a few holes in it letting out the gas and guide it safely to land. Or toss a bunch of cats right on top of it.
Civilians in Montana.... more cows than people.
Since when does the Pentagon care about civilians' safety?
Tail hook it
Ehh they’d really be starting WW3 if they did that
笑死我了，CIA监控全世界怎么没说
The Pentagon is compromised
SpaceY ?
Could they fear a possible chemical or biological agent on it? Pop the balloon and infect/poison the population? I bet the military can do a halo jump and bring the balloon down without popping it.
Funny thing is, no one knew until it got spotted.....it's a balloon lmao
What if the spy balloon is just the transmitter to for the mind control chips that were installed in everyone who got a COVID vaccine??
There's no threat! It came through Canada a couple of days ago. U.S. government had determined the balloon does not pose a threat.
It's. A. Balloon.  How hard is it?
How many civilians are in Montana anyway. Just tell people to hunker down for a few minutes  and shoot it
How about evacuate the area and then demand it to land or else? I mean are we just gonna do nothing?????? The fuq?
They should shoot it down!
No need to shoot it down. We can gain more intelligence on what they are using and their interests. We know what we have and probably it’s even good they know a bit so they think twice before doing anything stupid.
Lol blow up fucking balloon spy no? What are ya looking at it .... ? Oh wait why worry ahhh fuck around and find out ...?
The question is why was it not shot down before reaching USA? #spyballoon #polqc
Good to know they’ll let spies in the country to keep citizens safe… WAIT WTF—NEVER HEARD OF EVACUATION… Wow the incompetence is stunning…
Someone's gonna shoot it down eventually.
Oh puhleeze if they cared about our safety they wotluld have grown a spine by now.
Civilians? Isn’t it right over a nuclear launch site? Maybe shoot it down and risk it??
The balloon
Cowards
I not buying that story. Lots of wide open spaces with little to no chance of injuries to civilians.
I'm highly skeptical. Why send a balloon - all the way from China? Why not just use a satellite or private planes? Or drones? A balloon from China makes no sense.
BREAKING: Pentagon says China sent spy balloon over Montana, home to one of the most sensitive U.S. military installations, which oversees Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles to gather intelligence, days before Blinken’s Beijing trip.  Your reaction.
They are testing our Balls!
It makes no sense to you because you don't understand military technology. We use spy balloons ourselves. They can hover with relative low energy requirement for long period at extremely high altitude in the same spot.
Blinken should cancel his trip to Beijing until there is a public and verifiable acknowledgment and explanation from Xi.
They're VERY hard to spot. Invisible to radar, and require virtually no energy to operate for long periods.  Who knows how long that thing has been there. We are about to be attacked folks.
Maybe because they can
Balloons cannot be steered. For this reason, surveillance balloons are tethered. If this is a Chinese spy balloon it was launched from US soil.   This is a false flag op.
Maybe China asked permission and got it? Maybe this more FEAR mongering
China has no ingenuity without foreign assistance, maybe it’s the best they can do
Inside job!
People like you are the reason the Chinese are allowed to get away with this shit.
Oh, please expound upon the "people like you" part. I'm dying to hear you explain yourself.
Agree. It makes no sense. It looks like a weather balloon. Sounds like the Pentagon overreacted by scrambling their fighter jets and are now trying to save face. If it was a threat, they would have shot it down, not turned around and gone home.
说的很对，对于一个把洗衣粉当作大型杀伤武器的国家来说，这很正常。但是我认为敏感的警惕性是好的。
Well it worked! It’s not being shot down! And it’s over the heart of where our ballistic missile program is! Why isn’t Biden shooting it out of the sky?
Maybe the ballon has something in it that CCP wants to decimate. They already send fentanyl to kill up to over 100k Americans a year.
IKR? Why not just pay Hunter to contract a domestic drone operator to get whatever aerial pics they want along with documents from the big guy? I dunno, maybe  is more cost effective. Or, the real reason was the optics. 
Because they can use the excuse of, “oh it’s just a weather balloon that strayed off course…” that’s why.
因为那就是一个普通的气象观测用的气球，真有威胁拿下来拆开看呗
Now we have murder balloons floating over the US from China...
What's a murder balloon?
Murder balloons 
...as Japan actually did in WW2. Must be the trade winds.
Hopefully the spy balloon from China over Montana can safely be dealt with.  Good hunting!
🚨NEW: A massive spy balloon from China has been surveilling the United States. It is described as the size of three buses and includes a technology bay - ABC
They followed the string from the China spy balloon and it was tied to Swallwell’s chimney…
just because it says made in China doesn't mean it's a spy balloon from China
You better start preparing. You better start training.  You better stop arguing about gender identity, racism, or the next hot topic to divide us is. Either start learning Mandarin Chinese or put down your phones and start getting ready for what is coming.
China claimed the balloon was theirs
A spy balloon sounds like something from the 50s. Why would China send a spy balloon into US air space when they have advanced Satellites?
Official Statement from Hayden Ferguson:  “China sent a "Spy Balloon" over U.S. military sites. Perhaps the U.S. should make it "open season" and fully legal for citizens to shoot down any balloons seen in the sky!” https://t.co/q1GwkKHrYA
Let me see one! I’d pop it and drop it!
It's a bit too high up for that. lmfao
⚠️ HAPPENING NOW: US fighter jets tracking spy balloon from China that is over Montana.   There are over 150 nuclear missiles in Montana. https://t.co/xuktZ0dK30
Of course we know its from china lol
Thats a sateloon not a spy balloon. That is a real satellite,which r balloon based,not in space. Facts
You must be the speech writer for Anthony Fauci
Looking at real estate for sale?
Hunter Biden let them launch it from the backyard of Joe's Delaware mansion....
NORAD bested by stolen Chinese WW2 Japanese Balloon bomb technology I will sleep well tonight.
And how many Chinese army divisions in Canada rn?
Just poke it and let the Chinese explain why they needed it there
And ND has some really sensitive areas, too. Even if there is little concern for seeing something, aren't there other dangers, like dropping something?
Planet dim-sum
That the balloon? If so, nice vid.
We will let see what we want them to see. Shhhhhhhh!
Fighter jets? 3 KC 135s... 
Take it out
They know Biden won’t do anything
I hope our jets can keep up.
What are we waiting for shoot it down hello wake up
They don’t need a balloon, they got Swalwell…
Kill it.
Definitely aliens
CCP laughing at us.
great..now the commies are mapping out targets in north montana.  our “leader” has been in bed since 5pm.
Shoot it down
It’s China or Aliens ?
Pop...
Settle down. The alarmist rhetoric is absurd. The Chinese, as well as the Russians, have spy satellites above our ICBM silos literally 24/7/365.
Launched from one of the farms they bought?
You can Google the maps of the icbms and drive right up to them - lol - its not a secret - come on people get a life
and one nuclear balloon can end it all
Weather balloon from China. The "Al Gore 1". Just checking emissions.
#ElonMusk   Take this out please
not a spy balloon
what ship is that?
Shoot it down.
Can’t they just pop their balloon? I see little kids pop balloons all the time! 
Well so much for keeping that secret
It's Uranus.
We probably sold them some of our airspace
Check the silos!!!!
if its full of their viruses?
Please tell me how a fighter jet tracks a balloon travelling at 10 mph.
They shouldn’t need the expense of a balloon when they can just read your posts for intel
Montana and ND are expendable. Nothing there but a few welfare recipients
It might be as well full of poisoning chemicals to be released over US.???
There’s so much our government is hiding from us it’s criminal.
Thanks for telling how many missiles we have good fucking job!
What do you China would do if the US flew a spy balloon over China?
Someone with a telescope get us a better shot.
Why fighter, isn't radar picking it up?
Why does it always seem like everytime they see something weird they always blame china?? could it be something from cuba, mexico or canada?
The Chinese always had these balloons checking the atmosphere, climate.  Don't see why all this fuss
someone needs to oops remove that thing over our airspace
Is it spreading covid or something else??? What is it doing up there and why is it allowed???
Um, I think that was supposed to be a secret.
shoot the damn thing down. what's the hold up?
It's not a good idea to shoot it. It's better to glue some weight to it and slowly drop it to the ground.
And who said letting them buy up all the land in the country was a good idea.  We are so comprised by the ccp isnt not even funny
Bullshit
Biden will return it with some documents from his garage. Everyone has to pay the big guy.
Tracking?  In 1960 the Soviets shot down a U-2 with a pilot &amp; nothing came of it;  rightfully so as the USA was in Soviet air space.  Fast forward to 2023, and our government has a sense of trepidition acting appropriately to secure its air space.
quick... someone tell the kid sniffer that the balloon is actually Russian. He'll shoot it down in a heart beat.
So our cell phones ain't being tracked bye china because they make our cellphone and ticktok collects data are you people that blind sided now
If trump was president, he would be pissing on its grounded carcass right now
Why haven't they captured or killed it?
We need to block it's signal take it down but not pop it we have no idea what their plan is or if it's carrying some new virus it's a threat We NEED to Address nothing should be ALLOWED in our air space from them.
Joe biden is a threat to national security
Biden is probably on the phone right now frantically looking for a pair of testicles.
Now we see what all the Chinese money given to the Bidens was for. Free access to America/Americans..
Why track it? Shoot it down and summon the Chinese ambassador to the White House. Oh fuck, wait, never mind.
Why are we not shooting it down? Does Joe not want to offend his boss Xi?
And it is very near our military installation where we believe there are silos and the Chinese CCP have acquired large plots of land...  Well and the
Shoot that s*** down don't take no chances
Shoot that shit Down don't take no  chances
Someone shoot it down
Those damn Chinese! Why can’t they stay on there side of the world… oh wait… the US is in everyone’s business, except their own
The Duttons can’t ever relax smh
If it is violating US airspace, then shoot it down.
It was lunched from China? It Flying over the Ocean. It Entered U.S. Air space. And It was spotted over Montana?  It seems like Gulf of Tonkin Incident 2.0 to provoke China
你们这群美国政府的宣传媒体，把美国人洗成脑残了
Boom..should have been this report
Let’s wait till it gathers all the info it needs before shooting it down. Great job American military commanders!
Maybe loaded with covid virus  think twice before burst it!
It’s in US air space, blow it to hell,out of the sky!
who believes this shit, spearhead technology as if it were ww2, it is a meteorological balloon and they want to instill fear
If that was over Russia it would have been shot down the moment it was discovered. But we spend thousands of dollars trying to figure out what to do.
so this Chinese balloon is hovering over Montana a state that has most nuclear development and China is saying it's only a weather balloon. Does anyone else find it odd, not New Mexico, New York, Utah but a state with a major nuclear reputation.
It’s insane that communist China has a spy balloon floating over the Unites States of America RIGHT NOW and the Pentagon refuses to shoot it down. So they do not take Biden seriously!
Reporter: China is buying up land near U.S. military bases. Is this on the administration’s radar?   Co-Press Secretary John Kirby: That’s “a little out of my swim lane.”   Reporter: “This is a national security issue.”   Kirby: “I’m not the right person to ask about this.”
I'm pretty sure if President Trump was still in office either they wouldn't attempt anything like this or President Trump would have shot  that sumbitch out of the ski
Here we go. Let's see who's going to be stupid enough to believe China has sent a "spying balloon" to US territory.   Oh, wait, these are Americans; they believe pretty much anything.  All you have to do is repeated often enough. (Maduro,  Castro, WMDs, Kadafy, Homosexuality).
Could the Chinese balloon possibly be a vessel containing GERM WARFARE, like a Trojan Horse? (Balloon may be releasing germ warfare?).
There are pictures of a SPY BALLOON from CHINA hovering over Montana . . . We wouldn't have a SPY BALLOON from CHINA if TRUMP was in office.
China is dropping a cord from their balloon and I'm clipping it to my belt and riding the balloon back to China.
Enjoy boiling your drinking water
DEVELOPING: A spy balloon from China has been surveilling the U.S., says senior U.S. official. https://t.co/gNDQluCfU7
"Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years, including prior to this administration," according to senior defense official.
How does this affect Mike Trout’s legacy?
Hey you have any maps
Another story said this is a common occurrence and the only difference is how long it has stayed.
I'd be a bit more worried about their dozens of spy satellites than a single balloon.
Pop it!
Jimmy Carter’s America smh
Should be easily resolved, no?
Probably laughing at us
Is the balloon TikTok  ?
A "spy balloon" has made it all the way over here from China and its still in the air surveilling?!?!
Whoa whoa whoa they already have TikTok they don’t have to go zeppelin on us
Cover story for a ufo I bet...
may be a weather ballon
I have a suggestion.
Have the Chinese not heard of satellites? Much more secretive 
Shoot it 
They need to send somebody up there to see if they can shake the spy out
Not to mention all the surveillance devices in every copy of The Palmer Hotel, a collection of spooky short stories set over a century at a downtown hotel.  ($15, Venmo: Rick-Paulas, PayPal: Include address)
Yet everything is made in China.
Ain’t nothing spy about a 3 school bus sized balloon.
This is what we've waited for  This is it, boys, this is war The President is on the line  As 99 red balloons go by
Red Zeppelin
How did they think they would hide this
Pop it
Shot it down!!!
Be curious if it's over northern united states but what about Canada too unless Alaska...
Ok but to be fair. What is a balloon surveilling that isn’t already online on display.
It’s true and they just got more information on the Chinese spy balloon
Oh the humanity !
may i see it
Knew that bootlegged copy of  UP would come back to haunt us
Biden is taking care of it. God bless
How many spy satellites does each country have pointed at each other? Come on now.
Bidens America
easy fix just poke it
oh wow i certainly hope we haven’t also been spying on china, that would really make it hard for us to complain and be taken seriously
It’s a weather ballon it’s Superman in the sky great work on the defense system we have way to go guys keep napping 
I saw it !!
Prepping us for alien invasion… remember this tweet 
sorry, that was mine. i wanted to get a better view of the U.S. collapsing
Lmaooooooo. I’m sorry. But that is a tad funny
Is it flying over "Mar A Largo"..
Kinda doubt they need a balloon to spy when each country has 5000 spy satellites pointed at each other
Shoot it.
Wow wonder what they're looking at? I just use Google Maps to look at stuff!
remind me of the evidence that it's from China, or are we just taking the word of the intelligence community again.
Probably checking to see if all the junk we buy from them is working out.
But yet we are a secure country
Be nice if we didn’t have a President who is beholden to China about now
I’ll handle it
Better dump another three trillion in defense to beat this balloon technology
How about looking here as well
We need to ask questions.. multiple videos show a "hovering" ufo.. Chinese are that advanced with balloons  that can hover in one place with all that wind that high?
It’s prob a weather balloon lmao
I wonder how many US balloons are over China
sewed into said balloon
Could this explain the recent “ufo” sightings?
Y’all got google map or no
It may have the capability to drop and then glide small shoebox sized drone gliders.
By the way - and were caught cheating on their spouses and a banding their children by having an affair but there is no information of any kind relating to their firing on your websites so what kind of fair and unbalanced news agency are you?
If only our 817 billion dollar defense budget could handle a balloon.
The spy balloon 
we are weak
Anyone hear from yet?
Go figure hmm 
What?
$817 Billion and nobody at the Pentagon has one of these
So you are telling me that you cant find a safe place to shoot this down in Montana?   You cant find one single safe open space with no people in Montana?   No part of me can believe that one bit.
Bring it down.  They won't think twice about doing it to us!! Stop them from buying our land it's not allowed...grow a pair
how dare they do to us what we do to them?
mr. joe biden must nuke shanghai
DEVELOPING: so do we who cares
Holy shit, here's what it looks like
Why do they need spy balloons when they have TikTok?
Chinese spy balloon has been spotted over the US in past years, but pose no threat?   None that they're able to identified yet.  By the time they do, it's too waiting for a breach to be discovered?
#TenPercentForTheBigGuy
We should send a Godzilla robot over there
Another Pearl Harbor?
How do they know it is from China, has anyone visited the baloon and confirmed it.  Seems like the European war is not enough..
Delivering Hunter's next payment.
What would be the reasons China did this? One could be to make us aware they are spying on all of us already? They knew we would see it. There could be alot of reasons they did this.
Could this be it? I took this near Saint Paul, MN so I’m not sure if it’s even possible to see it this far away if it’s over Montana but it sure looks like the other videos I’ve seen.
What kind of communications does it use? RF? LoRa? Inquiring minds need to know!
China: -1 Chinese Spy Balloon. US: +1 Chinese Spy Balloon.
I knew them blimps look suspicious!
Quite the snooper, aren’t ya…
Maybe can phone in a favor to Fang Fang to get it the hell out of here.
My first reaction to this tweet was, “OMG they are covering actual news”
Was Fang, Fang, flying in it?
Just cover it with a large plastic bag...
Are they going to say that it's a Balloon?
go up there hook on to it..... and tow it back to earth....then send them an invitation to come pick it up
This is what the China balloon looks like.
okay. So what?
Shhh... they think it's a satellite.  You'll hurt their feelings!
How do they know it is for surveillance and not some other nefarious thing, like, say, dropping something?  I get the concern, but this thing is in our airspace and is unmanned.
Has China made any agricultural purchases?
Take it out.
Surely there is a safe way to capture the balloon and its technology?
How did it get here and how long has it been here. How many have we had so for?  Did Scottie beam it in?
Why do they need a balloon when everyone is on TikTok?
Instead of talking about it, do something about it.
Oh look!  It's Xi!
They are just "Peking" at us.
Using a balloon instead of satellites......is this a sign of inflation in China?
Not surprising considering todays military is more concerned with diversity than they are with qualifications.
This may all be due to inflation.
How much money is in the defense budget for slingshots?
I always thought MSM strived to be accurate.  This is no balloon:
Cool.
He's not spying.  He's trying to get to the honey.
Don't care
Let that thing come over my house and it'll be laying in the back 40
This is ridiculous
It’s triangulating with everyone’s TicToc app!!!  QUICK EVERYONE DELETE IT NOW!!
How the F that happens in Montana?
It’s aliens not the Chinese
I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump and family hid them and provide blind spots and methods to do it
Why don't we just blow it up
China would never release a virus from a balloon over another country. No chance!
Sleepy Joe probably invited them to have a balloon party!
Here’s some breaking news ABC. Are you aware that a Republican Congress woman of New Jersey was MURDERED yesterday? Maybe do a story on that instead of your continual focus on Santos.
What's the "spy balloon" name, Tick tock or insert any other social media name or search engines and also is this "spy balloon" powered by steam
China is buying a lot of land I can see why They want to buy more and live here I'm just guessing
It’s a stray weather balloon pushed off course by a bird fart.
Let me get this straight, if a guy walks onto your property unwanted in America youve got the right to defend yourselves and often do, yet the Chinese are actively over your air space and you do nothing but observe... literally makes no logical sense...
If they really want to see how it’s going they can just create an account on Nextdoor.
Xi wanted to visit.
Ask Joe Biden he probably set it all up
This should not be happening.
It's not really a spy balloon when everyone knows it's a spy balloon 
If in the right area a small nuke EMP would knock out 50% to 75%+ of the USA. Rebuild would take a few year’s minimum. THAT might be why shooting is not an option as that would definitely cause an atmospheric nuclear incident over Montana and East over the US and across to the EU
Keep spying. It's fine. Biden is ok with it
Army officials:&nbsp;military installations are a no-fly zone for unauthorized drones.  But it is fine for CHINA TO DO IT!
Can we just take it out?
The bigger question is what are they dropping along the way ! Wait soon it wb another virus !!!
Why is this news? You guys been spying at each other for decades now.
Meanwhile, in China:
This is not a surprise what is how long it took you to realize it.  What about them tracking aircraft carriers in the pacific?!
Probably making plans for the land they might ask for to pay off the debt they have over us
Are we really surprised by this?! C'mon now.  They own huge amounts of our land too...how bout putting a stop to it! And maybe stop using all their tech on our communications systems...just a thought
LeSpyballoon
It’s market equities spying on the Yellowstone Ranch.
Well since Bidens documents are being found all over the place.. He now is just holding up the documents outside the window for the balloon 
Balloon boy rides again!
Was it TikTok?
This is embarrassing!
How has this not been destroyed yet?  What the heck..
should we shoot it down
It used to be so easy for Beijing to get the money and crack to Hunter Biden.. now look what they have to resort to.
Ok so?
It should be blown out of the sky and the video of it being destroyed shared virally.
Luci will return... 666 $ninefactor 999. I'm calling... answer.
So had a giant social media app…so nothing new. Thanks for the update, Sherlock!
Ohhhhh. U mean all them UFO’s people been claiming to see
Ya ya he sell that balloon at dollar store
Shoot it down
Why is it talking so long for President Hunter and VP Joe to shoot this thing down?
blow it out of the sky n take the pieces..tape it to a war head and send it back to china!!!
Shoot it down
There are two things that do not concern them, or will China swallow America within the next 100 years, or America will slaughter this great beast from Taiwan. Did you know that the Chinese in America take hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to buy everything in America?
Are you guys aware the Nigeria is breaking up for the following reasons?

🚨BREAKING: A massive spy balloon from China has been surveilling the United States. It is described as the size of three buses and includes a technology bay. Pentagon says not safe to shoot it down - AP/ABC https://t.co/99fmyDdxgM
Where?
Not safe to shoot it down?
Where does it say made in China? It's going to be very embarrassing when that is not the fact..
Shoot it down so I can see it. Right now all I see is a bright dot.
And how do we know it's from China? And how come we don't get to have space balloons? Or do we we? And is there like a space balloon pilot? And who first saw the space balloon? Ok, I'll stop.
I'm kind of jazzed about the whole spy balloon from China right now. I just keep picturing sending up a cat or toddler from our "space force" to take care of it for us or something equally fun. Also, how do we know it's spying? And I'm too intrigued to be concerned...
If we had an oversized slingshot we might stand a chance against that political spy balloon from China. #TheOcenasekNews
Why wasn’t the large balloon from China floating over US not shooting down, it’s a spy balloon. China would wait one second to shoot down an American balloon, US government didn’t do shit.
A large spy balloon from #China has been surveilling the US but will not be shot down, say Pentagon officials.
The U.S. thinks it's a high-altitude balloon from China that entered domestic airspace a few days ago, according to a senior defense official.
BREAKING: The United States government has detected and is tracking a high altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now that the US government to include NORAD continues to track and monitor it closely, balloon is currently traveling at
an altitude well above commercial air traffic does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground, says Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder.
This is not the first time a surveillance balloon has come into domestic airspace. It is appearing to "hangout for a longer period" than in previous instances, the senior defense official said.
The U.S. will not say the exact altitude, but it is above where civilian air traffic is active, a senior defense official said.
The U.S. has used manned military aircraft, including F-22s, to observe the balloon, a senior defense official said.
In previous instances, Chinese high-altitude balloons did not loiter for long over the continental U.S., a senior defense official said.
I wouldn't characterize the payload on this as "revolutionary," a senior defense official said. What is different is that it is loitering over the U.S. for a prolonged period.
CHINA IS GOING "Old School" the US used that tech in the 50s before satellites .
What if it's from Russia?
No issue......just a Chinese New Year wish balloon 
Thinks?? Ugh, need to work on that..
If the U.S. actually cared about Chinese surveillance they would ban tiktok
WTF are they waiting for, shoot it DOWN
Following that weather balloon from China?
Three US air force planes are circulating over northern Montana.
I am pretty sure that you woudn´t send tankers to do that.
Go figure Ukraine simp with yet another shit take
Genuine question: Anyone with a credit card can buy high-res satellite imagery of almost anywhere on Earth. What is this balloon getting China that it can’t get from its satellites?
Makes sense
That would literally be the only thing we aren't actively posting online for free.
I would assume Electronic intelligence (ELINT) or Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). There's been some well-informed speculation that a bunch of UFO sightings near military assets are actually balloons sent by foreign operators to trigger a response and gain electronic intelligence.
Satellite imagery isn't usually available as a real-time feed, particularly commercially. Also there is a huge amount of passive signals and other electronic data that can be collected from high altitude devices that cannot be picked up from orbit.
news coverage
maybe its satellites don't work any better than its covid vaccines which are complete failures. cc
Aggravating Americans
A "spy balloon" has made it all the way over here from China and its still in the air surveilling?!?! https://t.co/NN02EGpGxe
DEVELOPING: A spy balloon from China has been surveilling the U.S., says senior U.S. official.
They want to announce it on the news to generate outrage and public support for action against China.  Normally, when this happens - and it happened all the time - it would be shot down unceremoniously.
Just for the last 2 years.  Well get around to popping it sometime.
  White balloon privilege
Exactly
Yeah not like china have ship or planes or anything...
President Biden was briefed and asked for military options. convened a senior DoD leadership yesterday, and officials discussed shooting it down. Top generals strongly recommended against that "due  to the risk to safety and security of people on the ground."
BREAKING: The U.S. gov as detected and is tracking a high altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now.   "We do not doubt that this is a PRC balloon," said a senior defense official.
This is not the first time DoD has detected a balloon of this nature over the continental United States
Yesterday, flights were grounded out of Billings Logan airport. Montana is home to which operates silo-based nuclear missiles.   "Clearly the intent of this balloon is of surveillance. The current flight path does carry it over a number of sensitive sites."
Good, I'm glad we're not starting a war over a balloon.
Why the hell would a war start because of the U.S. military shooting down an unauthorized balloon over U.S. airspace? Not realistic... It's their right do do whatever the hell they want to a balloon over their airspace.
Gotta say. I don’t feel very safe with the thing floating above me either. Take it down.
How many thousands of miles of barren land in this country, but you can't find room to safely take down a balloon the size of a school bus? Sus imo
Nah, just shoot it.
The fuuuuuuu!!!!!
Sucking up ALL our data….
Send up our Goodyear Blimp!
In my humble opinion: this is a Chinese declaration of war.
Just popped into my mind what if it's full of something to kill americans ugh
We are going to have to figure out how to shoot these balloons down safely then, because there will be more and we can't allow that
That’s a completely inadequate explanation. The “top generals” are not in their positions due to their battlefield acumen (see General Mark “Any way the wind blows” Milley).
How about we take Putin out first
In Montana?
I recommend blowing it to smithereens.
First question: Why isn’t that thing on fire yet?
It seems like we could ‘attach’ to it and bring it back to a base.  This seems more logical than allowing it to data gather without knowing what they’re looking g for.
Safety my ass Its a freaking balloon
a .. balloon .. over .......... northern Montana ........
Popping it might work
Tow it somewhere safe before popping it
If it was a Chinese warplane flying over South Dakota, would they recommend against it?
Call in the professionals.
Well then, shoot the payload full of holes and let ballon fly back to china.
Can the American people just agree we’re totally fine with the risk?  This is unacceptable.  Make a statement. Down the fuckin thing.
Safety, and risk of injury to people on the ground??  What the fuck is in this thing??!!
Stupidity abounds. I'll fuqing do it.   Give me a parachute, a knife and a winning attitude.
Most of the top brass at the Pentagon have  for brains.
Pentagon: Chinese spy balloon spotted over Western US (from #spyballoon #China #Pentagon #USA #balloon https://t.co/uRkHj1WngK
It's a good thing I'm not President. I'd order trash from California shipped to Texas and Florida in response to their ridiculous migrant deportation attempts. Then, with that China balloon, I'd go ship barges of trash to get dumped at Chinese ports, just dumped all over.
That'd be my policy. Anyone who acts trashy just gets trash dumped on them. I'd be dumping our trash all over the place.

Why do they need spy balloons if they have satellites ?
Now do TikTok!?!
So fuckin pop it
Why would they need a spy balloon when they gave us tik tok.....
Well pop that shit!
Maybe Joey will ask for a ride
Pop it!!
That just want to watch the in the
I feel good knowing that it's only the size of 3 busses and we did nothing to stop it before reaching the continental United States. 
Where are the Dutton or Rip when you need them??
Shoot it down
Shit about to be up fr
Take it down, fold it up and fedex it back
Elon bout to grab it
We finna die 
Shoot it down
So did they shoot it down, and why spy balloon when they have satellite &amp; goggle maps...
China could just use Google Earth 
That’s nice.
  move along 
Shoot it down!
They own some lands here in Montana right?
Brother it is 2023 if anything I can tell you that no major country in this world is using balloon tech for cheeky pics of other nations.
There is another one over Canada coming our way . They own so much here do they really need them.
What is this the 1960s? They thought we wouldn't notice? I give up!
It was seen over Eagles Practice
I mean who cares honestly. Let em watch
What's the sanctions? What ramifications? This administration won't be happy until ww3 hits.
Dumping COVID Story should have read massive spy balloon shot down attempting to enter the US. How did it get that far ?
Iam thinking you 6abc sock puppets are blowing kisses at it.
This wouldn’t have happened under Trump, #facts #JustSaying #FJB
Should have been shot down!
I think this points to someone in government is compromised and afraid to act.  Common sense and the country’s protection means nothing based on the inactions of the last 25 months.  Reminder:  China is a Communist country. They don’t do good for people in the world.
Sooo we just gone sit here and watch the damn ballon collect info on us knowing we beefing with them. The US stay getting chumped. China aint to b played with tho look how they did us with Covid. 
This is all optics - Plan-Demic. Wake up, sheeple
Biden and hunter are working on this.  They are still in cohoots with China .
Biden doesn't have the courage to stand up to China and shoot that balloon out of the sky. It's a bunch of nonsense that he won't have trained military planes follow it &amp; destroy it. Probably destroy his deals with the Chinese dictator. So obvious to everyone!
Will it endanger your Chinese money making deals to shoot this balloon  out of the sky? That's what it looks like to us.
People are not questioning that this alleged china spy balloon managed to fly from China... to *MONTANA* of all places and is now spying on.. a secret something without ever being caught on radar... or seen by planes?
Suspected Chinese spy balloon found over northern U.S. “The United States government ... is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now," said a Pentagon spokesperson.
Don’t be naive… you don’t think the Chinese could launch that from the hundreds of thousands of acres of property they’ve bought in the USA?
Any way to trace the first tweet about any #hashtag?  Curious to see who verified it.
China’s military trains and operates openly in Canada. China is also buying huge swaths of land in the US. Malstrom AFB has many ICBM silos.
so China's military has already infiltrated US soil and has been building military infrastructure for decades?  Wow never knew that thanks.

The Spy Balloon is a fairly large and we can’t have it flying over use. Send F16 and Drones up there to blow it up. I don’t trust the Chinese one bit. I am sure they vials dangerous viruses they are to drop on USA. Where are the Chinese controlling the balloon from. #CNN #China
Do you think spy balloon from China has anything to do with Moscow setting up air defenses in the city? Possibly preparing for something big?

We need Cheryl Burton to investigate this
Judy Hsu has a terrible dress , but she is so beautiful
Are we sure it’s not the Balloon Boy family from Colorado back at it again?
Wait, it was on the ground and you let it go back up? Huh?
She is to die for.  Beautiful oriental woman , love her hair

Saying that the spy balloon came from China is racist!
The balloon from China flying over the USA is the same type of “Trial Balloon” our own government used with COVID-19. Both parties want to see how much they can get away with. #ChinaBalloon https://t.co/fj1NVXBl8e
Maybe we missed a balloon payment on one of our loans from China
Headlines from 2 months ago "China is buying up American farm land." Current administration."who cares"  Headlines today. "China Spy balloon the size of 3 busses watch sensitive areas of Montana."  Current administration."who cares"
Current administration just blocked a Chinese corn mill that was going to be built i North Dakota.  They blocked it because they thought it was going a spy operation. They were buying up land during the previous administration and they didn’t care either.
Current administration? The corn mill was blocked because over 5,000 local residents signed a petition to block the China owned mill....The US Air force ruled that it will be be blocked.
The federal government asked for the cities help to keep a Chinese Corn Mill plant from being built according to flip board .com agricultural.

Basically, what I've learned from the China spy balloon saga is that I can just start launching my own balloons, and there's really nothing anyone can do to stop me
We should have more balloons everywhere all the time
China researches it, realizes their balloon is theirs, and publicly regrets that it has flown over the U.S. Why isn't this the end of it? Why does the U.S. have to provoke and point fingers and start acting like it's WW4 because there's a balloon from China nearby?
ALERT - “The airship is from China,” a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. “It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes.”
Maybe the US is hoping that no one will notice their military actually occupying a part of China in Taiwan.
Not that i like saber rattling with china But they’re more sorry they got caught than sorry they did it
They thought it is jesus or Allah and turned out a Chinese balloon. How frustrating. Not even a UFO.
Because War is profitable for the plutocrats that own our fucking government &amp; they're worried about predictions that the Chinese yuan will eventually overtake the US dollar as the world standard (in which case, the US would effectively collapse).
Because they're ignorant, fearful, psychotic cowards and bullies, never at ease unless they think everyone else is scared of them and subservient.
Because people like you amplify the story and the media runs on clicks
i saw cnn was doing live updates on their site like the election. they’re squeezing the story for all its got.
Seriously??
I lost my balloon from China earlier. Has anyone seen it?!
It would have to be a ruddy big balloon for anyone to see it, Billy... get your mum to tie it to your belt next time 
Yeah. She isn't great with knots at times 
I want my Balloon back 
Wasn’t a good idea to attach your mob to it either I’ve seen all sorts whole it’s up above trump doing some sports with biden playing hide to golf balls 
Hahaha no. I'm still learning  xx
They’ve shot it down so your mob will soon be back!! 
Is it a big white one ? If so, No , Haven't seen it.  
Big and white. Last seen. Oh. It's falling. It's okay 
It will be in Ireland now...
They shot it down 
Don't know weather you'll ever se it again !
One hell of a candle
It was last seen heading towards the Pentagon. I have no idea how you will retrieve that one.
One of the reasons I got out of the military is because our leadership decided to go woke. This is why we have a balloon from China floating around in U.S. airspace
That's not why we have a balloon from China floating over our airspace.
Then please enlighten me as to why we do then?
Can't wait till they release what was discovered in the payload
It is hard to wrap my head around all you Oath Keepers that took your Oath, not to a person but to our Constitutional Republic and what is happening now and what you went to war for to protect our borders while this admin literally is destroying everything you fought for.
And trust me it’s hard for us to watch what is happening to our country that we would still die for to this day.
Thanks for your service. I would have punched out too!
It's really that far gone. Getting too much like Canada or God forbid England. Both broken down to globalist puppet theatre.
Breaking News... China Joe's Balloon off it's Tether floating across USA. USAF researching manuals from 1917 to develope attack plan. Calling all Biplane Pilots! https://t.co/ql0jBPhchN
Don't misses/bullets/armory travel distances?  Or like guided missiles?  I think we have those don't we?  Maybe even the Hand of God weapon.
Look up in the Sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, No, It's just a Spy Balloon from China setting up their laser guided missile system on OUR defense systems in case of a pre-emptive strike! It floats across AMERICA looking for the targets it intends to destroy, Military DOES NOTHING
There actually is lots worse than that they can do from up there.  They've got our air, water, farms, food ...everything.  #ITrustGod
Are we sure it’s not a Jewish space laser?
It is a fucking absolute disgrace that we just sit back and don't do a goddamn thing!
That's why they bought Joe . They know we are a joke . Next a EMP . Nobody cares anymore we are doomed .
BIDEN DOES NOTHING  !! I'm sure our military has to be thinking WTF is going on !!
Well, if they shoot it down with booms it goes boom too. Nukes that blow in the wind up to 100k ft. have the most damage.  So... you are a pleb.
🚨 Breaking News!!! 🚨  China released this footage from their spy balloon while it was over Mississippi https://t.co/Az6JElYszh
Haha! Shots fired!
In Mississippi they like these
"please stop throwing bottles at our drone"  
Idk why people are freaking out about a “balloon from china” considering our country let’s them buy a ton of acres of land all the time🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ but the balloon is the deal breaker.
Technically it might be flying over their own land then huh?
It could be I guess yeah
Its all bs if you ask me. Distract the Masses with a Balloon, while we send advanced weapons to Ukraine to start WW3, memory whole the recent revelations about the Phizet Vax, the Document Scandal and last but not least Hunter Biden admitted this week the laptop was his.
Absolutely correct
Better that than never having a breaking point. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.  OUR PRESIDENT IS CORRUPT AND BEHOLDANT TO CHINA....NOT AMERICA.
I agree
I am so frustrated by the fact that I can't see anyone getting their acts together to organize nipping this sh*t in the bud.  So sad to watch my country fall apart due to cowardice by its own people.  This won't be solved by any other means.
It’s an unauthorized incursion into our sovereign air. Space
No I agree I’m just saying you can’t have it both ways
It’s not THE balloon that worries me.  It’s what’s INSIDE the balloon!? Could be bio weapons, anthrax, nuclear device, weather-altering chemicals… the list is endless!!!   It should be taken down &amp; inspected to KNOW what’s INSIDE IT!!! 
Of course it should
Good point!
Yeah.. The balloon is like a single ant in a roach, mouse, rat, and bat infested house.
Maybe they’re just surveying newly purchased farm land?
That’s what I said too. 
“Great Minds Think Alike.” Two others said the same in different ways. It would seem that everyone, with the exception of Liberals, knows that the CCP is buying our land.
I absolutely believe they are. And all close to military bases.
You are correct! And… The amount of CCP money being given to our Politicians, Businesses and Universities is astounding!
Our government thinks of themselves as the new American Aristocracy. We are nothing more than serfs! The Establishment Republicans and Democrats are one Party. (The Uni-Party) They don’t socialize with us and they don’t care about us! The more you know the more hopeless it seems.
Absolute truth! Every word!!!
They’re just doing a land survey on recent purchases
Many consider it an act of war. Letting them buy farmland and businesses, is more like treason. The sad fact is that we are too dependent on Chinese goods.
Yup, I’m pretty sure we let them buy a President as well
I worry they’ll do something to our grid.
Everything comes from China
The balloon is scouting for land to buy
DUA. It's a spy balloon.and could potentially be equipped with EMP technology or worse ..
Not to mention, most of our products are from China.
Because it’s China. There’s a lot of speculation and IMO, it it is not innocent.
I'm of a similar mind.
Thinking this myself… Diversion from what are larger, obvious threats.  It would be amusing, if I wasn’t an American.  Embarrassing otherwise.
They just doing surveys of what they own. Be over the White House next
I agree
A weather balloon from China? Makes perfect sense. Does thinking even exist anymore?
Every American deserves to turn on their faucet and have clean drinking water.
Every American deserves to look up in the sky and not see Chinese military aircraft flying freely over their home
It's a weather 
Because believing its a spy balloon is definitely top notch thinking lol  You think they get HD images on that thing like the satellites they have? 
Could that balloon be carrying and releasing some type of bio-weapon? It is from China.
They should capture it to see wglhat it's about.
Well, something should be done about it. But, not in gutless Joe's administration.
I expect Joe will let it go so not to upset his buddies in China.
Ok question I'd how did it get all the way to Billings without being detected....it is a balloon...it drifts with the wind...did it come from China, Canada or Montana...serious question..why we have RADAR
Yeah, that is a very legit question.
Interesting thought
You just have to wonder. I will NEVER trust China or this lousy, corrupt government!
Probably Covid 20.
I wouldn't doubt it, you never know.
Don’t trust them one bit
Me either...not for one second!
We don't know...and that is a PROBLEM. It should have been Identified/stopped LONG before getting mainland.
Agreed!
I guess Biden is waiting to see what they are going to do! He’s always late on everything because he simply doesn’t care!
No he does not.
THAT is exactly what I'm thinking!!!!
I agree Jaime. I only equate China with nefarious actions.
My thoughts exactly. As it slowly floats by. Why was it ever allowed to enter our air space? Anyone know what parts of the country it's passing over? It would be a good idea to track Illnesses in those states.
For the possibility of that alone, merits us shooting it down.
Good point
Our enemies are laughing at us....
Heckuva good question
world war 3 is on the horizon no joking
Giving us some lab created virus while taking our information. It’s only a Citizen Air Ship, off course, WAY OFF COURSE. But nothing to worry about. 
No...
Maybe, but I think it’s a spy thing.
False flag?
My thoughts run that gambit too.
That’s what I was saying
The balloon is releasing Right Guard all across the Midwest
Was thinking the same
Think Pfizer &amp; Bill Gates, rather than China &amp; spying...
It's probably got the SARS or Covid virus on the freakin thing.
Possible
We are concerned
Do we even know this is real?
Excellent question. One of many possibilities.
, like, covid- 19?.
The Chinese Blimp has allegedly already passed Montana, so it’ll be interesting to figure out what this is. twitter.com/MMtTreasures/s…
That was my thought as well.
I would not put anything past China.  Would not trust China at all.
Dr Fraudci is probably on board
It could be. More likely, it is doing deep scans of our missiles... info they couldn't get from satellite... so they know exactly which ones to target.
I doubt it's full of egg rolls!
A second balloon is flying over South America also, just reported.
Absolutely
could be, I don't put anything past China or for that matter our Govt. either
My thoughts!
Very possible
My guess we wouldn't hear about it if it was
My 1st thought
That’s the first thing I said. Since Biden’s military doesn’t have a clue isn’t this a treasonous act. You’re suppose to protect your country and it’s citizens?
The problem is we don’t know, and no one is trying to find out.
Exactly what I have been saying!
No need, we send Peter Darzsak to China again an he takes care of that! They work together!
Possible
Good thought! Mask up and stay home.
That’s my huge concern.
It's unlikely that was its purpose.
Killing our crops??? Us? Who knows… what a joke.
I've just said the same thing ! Apparently another one has popped up somewhere else !! Yikes !!
Hell yea.
Crazy but good question…no evidence we are taking air samples, is there?
Yep, could be, but in any case it needed to come down.
Bio-weapon possibly!  Let’s see if people start getting sick again.  Covid 2.0!  When are people gonna wake up!!
It is absolutely unbelievable! We literally have clowns running the show in this country.
Hi  Princess . Could it be spying over us? NORAD, what an embarrassment to the country? Imagine, if we landed  on the moon , couldn’t we land on a balloon ? Don’t we have a Space Force? How about all those missiles that we sent to Ukraine ? Obliterate it. 
Hello Carlos! I agree 100%. We deserve to know what's going on.
The only bioweapon it's releasing is higher level of idiocy among citizens...and it's not from China
Great question! There MUST be a reason our military won’t shoot it down or capture it. That said, if there is nefarious possible intentions, once it’s out to sea, BOOM! If not, why, compromised #DementiaJoe?
Maybe that's why they were flying military craft, and letting off fire bombs in the sky today, over Billings Montana?? Not attacking the balloon, just igniting the sky, with fire.
There is a rumor its a distraction from the Top Secret files and Hunty's laptop. Shoot the damn thing down.
Little too late,  all jabs are made in China and who knows what's in them.
Friends of old Joe's who knows. He's protecting them.
That could be the reason the gov't is afraid to shoot it down.
The new improved Wuhan-over-Montana flu....
Doubtful.
The ballon shows two things: 1. US vulnerability with this admin 2. "Soft disclosure" that ALL SATILITES ARE JUST BALLONS. The moon landing was fake &amp; the earth is flat. Your grandkids will look back and laugh at how gullible you all were for not knowing this!! Wake up people!!
If you’re looking for a new laptop, I highly recommend this article that breaks down some of the best laptops on the market in 2023
China Spy Balloon Spotted Over Metro St. Louis – Miles from Scott Air Force Base  https://t.co/hKjQkdCkdO
Wait till you find out about chemtrails
This administration is a disgrace
St Louis to China Spy Balloon
it's live-streaming waffle house fights on TikTok
They are simply returning Pelosi's hot air.
So you have the attention of the media, so what’s really going on?
How is it traveling so fast? Or are we not supposed to notice? Montana to Missouri overnight is quick.
This is definitely not tracking Santa's path with his reindeers and sleigh.
This is pathetic.  Biden compromised
This is all starting to add up now.
That thing is moving awful fast
How long will the Chinese spy balloon hover over the Pentagon and white house?
Shoot that Balloon down. Now   $2,000,000 dollars to anyone that does   #gogetit
See when everyone posts this crap! It’s just a cover up for something  Whatever
What can this balloon do that a satellite can't?
Of course, surveilling the military bases.  That's what the Chinese do!!!
Governors Can Shoot It Down...
They can’t, and even if they could the only thing that could get anywhere near it is an F-22. Those are only at a few bases.
Technically they can just looked it up... Some states have air defense also... Seems all governors and president is compromised and beholden to China.
Or, maybe, shooting it down is complicated because it’s the size of three buses and would rain down debris over a large area.
Maybe the Texas Air National Guard can shoot it down?  That would be so funny.
The Biden Administration are giving out our military equipments and now our military locations! WTH is going on?
Wtf shoot it down!!?? Why are we allowing this?
State Governor should declare it a threat and dispatch National Gaurd to shoot it down.
It's a test run for when they deliver an EMP
Ha ha ha, America has gone to fk under Joe Biden. Well done Americans, you have a war in Ukraine, World economy is shot, middle East blessed with free military equipment, China laughing at you. 
There is no civilian control of our government
Impeach Biden Phucker now. Treason period.
Spreading some super toxic animal flu I'd wager.  Bird, pig, bat, monkey, camel, this could be the hippo. The big one.
We're being trolled.  Give our Government's deep state connections with China, there are likely Chinese agents working within the bases.  Such a mess.  (But Biden did get 81M votes )
All is needed is poking a hole. Too bad, we don’t have the nerve.
It would be fitting of the Biden admin to just let a balloon slowly drift to where it wants to go and drop its payload.
Hey joe. That's one hell of a balloon payment. You think China will take payment in bitcoin?
China F’d our country for the past 3 years. And Biden sits by wirh an open border and Chinese spy balloons. Is this reality or a dystopian movie?
It's coming to pick up the CCP dogs.
There is a message on the Chinese spy balloon…
This crap needs to stop.  Biden has left our southern border wide open.  We are being invaded by drug cartels, criminals and terrorists.   Now China sending spy balloons.   What is next?  Biden and this administration needs to go NOW!!!
Bioweapon or EmP weapon! Shoot it down then catch it and reverse engineer it!
The Biden Regime will not protect US in a Chinese war!
Lol.  China’s latest and greatest spy tech is an easily observed and radar tracked gigantic balloon?  With apparently no maneuvering capability?  You really should get your head checked. 
At least this random ass newspaper is able to disclose the location unlike the fucking government
They show you a picture of a weather balloon  just like the said the jab would work  MSM I have to take my hat off to you ! What’s next ? I can’t wait! These weak minded ones will believe anything you tell them 
This has to be a fucking joke like wtf is going on there is also a 2nd one Sheez
Bio weapon? This thing may crash or just deliver a bio weapon at any time.
These fuckers took an oath to protect and serve us the people need to stand up
#WhatIsInTheBalloon
The LGBFJB Trans America Balloon Tour Sponsored by Hunters Business Partners at Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company
We spend 853 Billion on a Military , That cant stop a balloon from China. But is ready to go toe to toe with Russia ... I feel perfectly safe , How about you ?
This administration is a joke:  REPORTER: “Does the public not have the right to know...?”  PENTAGON: “The public certainly has the ability to look up in the sky and see where the balloon is.”
What makes you think it is too difficult for a fighter jet to shoot it down?
Thank God the Ukrainians are brave since you're so scared.
The Admiral Rachel Levine is looking for 'airspace' to fill in some hairy legged dude's rectum. Calm down
It’s around 60,000 ft according to reports.  So, based on your ‘technical knowledge’, since an F-16 has ceiling limitations we are defenseless against anything breaching our air space above 50,000?  And you expect to be taken seriously?  If only we had other aircraft...
An F-16 aircraft cannot fly much higher than 50,000 feet.  The balloon is around 100,000 feet.
Trump says it's a balloon payment from China...  Heading to Maralago
BREAKING: Republicans have been complaining about Joe Biden not shooting down the balloon from China all day.  Now the Pentagon says it also happened under previous administrations.  Guess who else also didn’t shoot it down…
Were you not saying it’s not a big deal lol, you are such a hypocrite
Yeah that makes it ok of course! 
Pentagon said Chinese have been spying on the US for a long time. There was an instance where it shortly crossed the airspace and continued to run close to US airspace. Not a defiant disregard of US airspace as they are displaying now.
That's US defense buddy...lol
Working with Russia is not a defense.
and somehow this makes it okay. If Trump did it then Biden can do it too. Everyone keeps comparing what Biden does to Trump, but you hate Trump so much? Sounds like they both make the same decisions, sounds like you should hate Both. Hypocrites.
I agree Tom , I don't understand the comparison it's not they say LBJ would have done this or that or Regan it's always Trump or Biden it's silly and hypocritical
I think that’s probably because they are the 2 geriatric men running for president in 24’
Someone help me, so this just didn’t just appear. The US and Canada must have been tracking it for sometime.   Where did it get launched from? Did it travel half way around the world and just got noticed in Montana
There are actually two there is one in USA and one in Canada
Fly above my property and you’ll be down next to me . Promise you that
That's funny ! Do you know how up this thing is ? Never mind that even do you realize how huge it is ? It won't be floating near your house
Doesn’t make it ok.
Sure thing 
Prove it, or it didn’t happen. “Pentagon says”. Give me a break.
Calling out hypocrisy is pointless.
U are pointless
Other administration's did not have the same tensions with China or the same untrusted dealings.
Because Trump had money in their bank and paid more taxes to them than us.
I am sorry you think I like or care about Trump. The polarity of your response shows only two ways of thinking. Many do not like either yet have no good alternatives. The security of the county is not a debate about what party you follow it is just a non-emotional decision.
I mean, it was obvious this was not the first time, but it had been something done for a long time
A balloon?
So that makes it a good idea
I know this is super embarrassing and a huge fail, but hear me out… What about Trump?
why is any of this news then? They control the narrative.
Obama?
"I'd like to buy a consonant..."
This statement is false
Shoot it down
But you have to remember, when a Republican does it, it is okay, or there is a reason for it, in their minds. It’s only when a Democrat does it, it is wrong!
What about the space lasers setting fire to our national parks
Can't just shoot it down. It's 150' x 300'. If shot down, it would do some serious damage to wherever it hit.
Please put in in writing .... who else??????
Yeah… these Chinese spy balloon stories I’ve heard my whole life are really getting old… wait…. This is the first one…
According to General Jack Keane this is not true. Also what Administration exactly?
Republicans are now actually saying it’s irresponsible to make this a Trump/Biden issue when national security is at stake.  Which is exactly what they were doing  until they found out it happened during Trump admin too? ( check Junior’s tweets ) #RepublicanHypocrisy
Your PAID trolling is getting sickening.
Honestly you can’t. It’s at 100k ft. Technology has surpassed ballon technology. Tells you all you need to know about China.  Truthfully it probably is a spy vehicle but meant for the Asian Pacific area. Did get caught up in the winds.
Do you question anything or just take what they give you as truth?
show me evidence of this happening b4..
Trump
Lol shut up girls
DISMANTLING DIVISION
Where are the facts? Let's see the video with the timestamps and the matching telemetry data.  Show me President Trumps Tweet about it, because if it happened, he would have Tweeted about it.
Boy stop lying
Ed, one thing that particular party in &lt;?&gt; esoteric need to mark and remember, and also learn it, know it and live it, simple Confucius proverb,6-5 BCE, never criticize snow on others roof, unless own door stoop is clean. Life is time, but some are intent on making it complicated
#ShootItDown
Two wrongs don't make a right!
Just heard them say it’s never happened before!
Cause it's not from China!
Bahahaha
I knew Obama didn’t have a spine either! And this proves it! Wow!
USA and China are number 1 and 2 in spy satellite systems.... i think a balloon is kinda null.
Where is the the proof of other Administrations doing this?
Found a photo of the “spy” balloon shortly after its launch.
where is that article. please share.
Who cares what other people did in the past? The proper question to ask is "What should we do now?"
Is this true
Don't you all ever get tired of arguing like kids?
Well it’s definitely on par with the leftist Elementary ideology and the “I know you are but what am I?” Responses they normally give
Exactly
USA sent a lot of balloons to Russia and China too. In 1974 China shot down a US spy balloon
BREAKING: the word BREAKING has lost all its meaning
45? Dutch?
Guess when it was never reported to have happened with no proof until now.   It’s funny how dems always play this game. “Your guy did it too”! Really? Prove it. Exactly.
You sir have been properly propagandized.
They are lying
What’s in the balloon?
Can we get someone at the Internet Research Agency to fix EdBots programming? It gives away the game that it autopopulates "BREAKING:" to the beginning of every tweet.
 Trump?
The Pentagon says,  they are freaking liars
So are you saying the Republican presidents got it correct? Or that they both got it wrong?
They want to push China to war
Obama?
Don't worry, one after the other, we have to drop off the package on the backseat in Den Haag first.
Was he overweight, has an orange tint and loves to cheat on his wife with Porn Stars ??
Trust whom you want to trust. Ask yourself "do you fell comfortable  with it flying over your head?"
I’m pretty sure that they said they’ve been tracked on the coastline, not above US ICBM sites
It doesn’t matter what he does, the republicans will complain.
“See, you also did bad thing so it doesn’t matter if we do bad thing too”
Gonna need some evidence to support the pentagons claim, sounds like the are trying to play clean up duty
Umm, let me guess. Obama.
Obama,
different times and circumstances...time to act!
I’m a Democrat and I’m complaining!
And most of all, didn’t even tell us about it.
WHATABOUTISM
Where your proof?
If it did happen, two wrongs don't make a right.
Not TRUMP ? Surely not
#IMPEACHBIDENNOW
Google Earth does the same thing
Oh come on, you ruined their moment
It doesn’t matter what they think, they are not the president!
Here we go
Dates and times please or it didn’t happen.
Liars and grifters..
I can find NOTHING that says spy balloon happed under trump admin. Links please?
Republicans aren’t the only ones saying the balloon should be shot down or forced to land, cf., Leon Panetta. There are a zillion legitimate reasons to condemn/mock the GOP. This isn’t one of them.
Im sure weve got cameras watching China all day long.
I care under about it under any administration.  I'm consistent......
It is 120,000 feet high.  Size of 3 busses.  80,000 is jet fighter ceiling.   If hit no control of what it lands on.
Chinas just making sure their investments are safe lol
Obeezy ?
to be fair,  they were too busy licking the orange idol's boots to look up
Obama ?
Which previous ones. Thought so
I read that it happened regularly, just not over these areas.
Hearing impaired, or dreaming?
Something else for Republicans to complain about.  I'm so glad they have nothing mote to do with their time and our tax dollars.
FOX and the GOP...
It boggles one’s mind that people don’t KNOW the Departmentof Defense is on this!
We all know the one that sold his soul to China and Russia 
I get the concern I really do. However, if it's shot down and hits civilians and injured them or died as a result, that wouldn't be good either. They have to be safe about it.
Does everyone commenting here not realize that there are Chinese satellites that fly over the U.S. everyday? And U.S. ones that fly over China? The U.S. can take down a spy balloon. IF it needed to.
Takeaway: It's fun to say things
Spy balloons have previously passed over the United States, but this object is unusual for loitering overhead “for an extended period of time,” defense officials say
If you really wanted to spy on someone why would you use a balloon the size of 3 busses to fly over the area? Seems odd to me.
China doing its part to reduce its Carbon Footprint.
Ooops
But was it made public like this?
Probably trying to distract from the jobs report.
Another balloon has should up in Latin America!
Screen shots are forever
#GOPHypocrisy
It’s was trumps hot air that filled it
At least it gives them something to talk about for the next 2 months since they have no agenda for the American people…..except hunters laptop….
And there's a 2nd balloon down in Latin America!
Funny, I don't remember seeing any pics or videos of these things when Trump was in office..
Obama?
Donald J. Trump
Are they sure that “spy balloon” isn’t full of some VIRUS or chemical that will kill us??
Your mom
Why do always screw up the messaging on this stuff?
Lol plus MTG told her followers to shoot the ballon down but I read the ballon is higher than air traffic so how lol
Let me guess, the metastasized orange haired boil on the republican party’s glutes?
And they still don't know how to capture a balloon.  Or are they allowing it to continue intentionally?  Either way we are not safe.
oh BS it did not and zero proof
Sure it did little fella
A l political vote move by do nothing Republicans
“But her emails…”
Happened before??? Never heard of it… State your source for when it happened before. Post your source link.
Maybe we should tow it back to China...and see if they freak out ..then we'll know if it's dangerous or not...
Any evidence of that, never heard that before, can't find anything anywhere else either. Smells fishy oh it ain't fish that's ********
I don’t know Ed … please give us verified data to back this propaganda you are peddling up? I won’t hold my breath
… but he didn’t shoot it down more strongly
I really didn't subscribe to this whole thing.  I just think that if our $800Billion/year Military Complex were not that worried about this thing, why the hell are the rest of us?
Hmm. Odd that this is getting called out under "China Joe" but "True Blue Trump" didn't tell anyone.
The Pentagon advised against it because the fallout could kill US civilians
The twice impeached so-called president?
Maybe just maybe... We are not shooting it down for a reason....just saying ...who knows
We're they in a proxy war with Russia at the time?
He should have as well puto!
The radical right wing extremist communist criminal republican leader Donald Trump!!!
The Chinese asset is still trying to down play it.
Somehow it won’t be Trump’s fault.
Of course.
Easier said than done.    Canadian pilots tried to shoot one down 25 years ago.  Shot over a 1,000 rounds at it with an F-18, and couldn't knock it out of the sky.
What about what about what about what about
Consistency is a sign of sanity...  ...lacking on a great many americans these days.  TBF, the public spectacle changes the perceptions significantly - but that spectacle is also largely about manufactured outrage for political purposes.
Or, it’s really an American spy vessel made to look like it’s from China. Our CIA spying on militias that might be preparing another insurrection? Hmm.
If he shot it down,  gop would be saying he starting ww3
Of course and it happened under trump.  He thought it was there because someone was spying on HIM.
They won't mention that
I’m pretty sure the balloon is just delivering dirty air for us to clean, all as part of the Anti-Green Old Deal written by GOP Secretary of the Interior Herschel Walker.
I have pictures from May 30th, 2021 of something similar to the recent balloon. I'm in Billings MT.
So you believe the pentagon this balloon has been floating above the US for 3 years now?
Obama, Bush...they probably didn't tell Trump, because he would have dropped it.  #Trump2024
Canada for one, since the balloon floated over their territory also.
Trump but republicans didn’t complain about it then.
Why did the Pentagon even announce that there eas a balloon this time when they never have before?
The official did say a few days ago that it's happened before.  Still wondering who didn't.
Obama
It was wrong then and it’s wrong now. Your comparison is stupid. Wrong is wrong, doesn’t matter who is in power.
Why did Trump keep it secret?
How do you know the intelligence agencies or DOD informed Trump about these surveillance balloons? We know they lied about the number of troops in Syria. They also spied on his campaigns and tried to remove him from office based of false claims.
Dude, your messed up… it’s not just republicans that think this is a disgrace… goes beyond politics, this is a national security fail still in progress
Oo yea Ed…what administration was that?? Obama’s???
Joe is chyna’s biatch
Obama
Well there you go he wouldn't have shot it down.
Secretary of Defense during the #Trump administration said there were no #spy #balloons over America during the Trump administration. Biden has permitted our airspace invaded and refuses to take action!
I’m reading this in that high pitched squeal I remember from the timcast appearance. Funny.
The spy balloon from China should have been shot down, and the Govt said their maybe casualties on the ground. There is a thing called evacuate before the shot. NORAD had to be following this from start to finish. Try doing this in China. We have the  weakest President ever. Ugh
Seeking the truth? Keep looking; you haven't found it yet
Thats right and I have not found the truth and neither has anyone else. Only god knows the truth. Just saying and when I die and go to heaven, I will then and only then will know the real truth. I keep the faith though.
Yup make no mistake our enemies are taking note.
These flights happen all the time. The military knows this and hides stuff.  chinese have a bunch of satelites spying on the west every couple of minutes. If yer stuff is in plain sight they know about it. Truly classified stuff is well hidden. If in your path give it the finger
Evacuate before the shot?
Shoot it down without knowing what's in it????
Destroy people's homes and ruin their lives because you're impatient?? 
Lol shoot down a balloon Lol you’re silly 
Fact and whomever voted for this bs , fu
U are looking for the truth? Here it is, U ARE STUPID.
I hope it lands in a remote part of the forest and starts this huge fire that kills a bunch of people, that would be totally worth it
You're an idiot.  You don't even know where the hell the thing will land.  Also, we would not be stupid enough to use a giant ass balloon that any idiot can see to spy. And neither is China.
The fascist right hyping the hell out of the spy balloon; pull the trigger they say - their solution to everything except the invasion of Ukraine. They say Biden is weak. They are being punked. Look, China gets much more from satellites than it could ever get from a balloon.
How did we find out about this China Spy Balloon?   We found out yesterday, yet the Pentagon admits to knowing about it for days or weeks.   Then, we found out in Jan about Biden’s documents, the FBI knew about it for mos. We found out from a press leak.   What else don’t we know
Biden and his crew KNEW about this since January 28!!!   JANUARY 27th!!!   Not only did they not inform the public, they Kept it quiet &amp; LET CHINA CONTINUE TO FLY IN OUR AIRSPACE (around our nuclear silos) and CONTINUE TO SPY!!!   How is this okay to go to the American public?!? twitter.com/BillFOXLA/stat…
It might have been good for pilots to know about it in case it blew down to where it would affect planes 
There so much hidden crap it's not funny!
Search Earths inner core and check out what pops up.
The people on the #EpsteinClientList
So much for transparency.  This is deception and treason.
At this point, anything they call a conspiracy theory is probably true.
Remember pentagon and the military are woke, basically protecting nation is not a priority
Now there are two balloons…
We know only what they want us to know
Probably more than we realize
All the uninhabited land across the USA and the Pentagon asserts that they don't want to shoot the Spy Balloon down, fearing it could cause damage. Really! The Enemy is Within!
China confirmed balloon’s origin - not alleged purpose - It is civilian airship for research, mainly meteorological. Affected by westerlies &amp; with limited steering, it deviated from planned course. China regrets unintended entry to US due to force majeure. https://t.co/66usNPNLg1
There could be a second one coming now.
Now China have confirmed the balloon is theirs, at least we know where the hot air came from~ #Fuckwits https://t.co/3GukOqoT5l
I wonder how many them will say ‘hands up guys, i got it wrong, sorry.’?
They’ll lean on ‘spy’ here. “No, we simply said it wasn’t a SPY balloon, not that that it wasn’t Chinese at all.”  I did enjoy seeing them all rush in with these takes, doing exactly the same sort of premature uninformed ‘analysis’ they like to criticize so much.
that's exactly how low-rank wumaos work - everybody apologizes in their own way without even confirming the official narrative.
For once it isn't DC.
One of them was clearly wrong, you can't find Hannah Montana with a weather balloon.
I mean has it been proven to be a “spy” balloon? China can spies on us and even see a gnat on our asses from satellites in space. Why would they need to fly in a balloon? It has to be a distraction for something more evil! Stay focused and awake!
I think they are tracking wind patterns, which can't be good. I hope they aren't about to release some kind of airborne bioweapon.
Ugh that freaks me out! This F**king admin is a clown show and has literally made this country a sitting duck! 
JAG, I think you are on to something.
Well I’d like to believe it’s something good … but that’s not the feeling I have, unfortunately 
Or….. they just want to see how easy would it be, and apparently it is.
Not really, there is a lot of data that can’t be gathered from low earth orbit but can from altitude, including communications, nuclear data and other things
The nsa is looking at you right now on your camera phone.
It's called testing the waters.....   They're looking for our weakest points and where to focus their attacks.
“Everything is fine. Everything is normal. Don’t worry about the Chinese spy ballon hovering over our nuclear silos. This is fine. This is ok. You can barely even see it. Go about your day”
Spy Balloon... what is this 1893?   ffs this story is a psy-op.
Does it not seem obvious to anyone they are tracking Russian aircraft's  path of least resistance? RU -&gt; AK  -&gt; over northern border. I'd imagine a lot more to this than meets the eye.
The Chinese sent that balloon to monitor their farmland.
Our leadership is weak. We know it, they know it, the WORLD knows it.
China balloon not trending but the Holly Spirit is now
#CarryOn
Hearing reports of three others.
It’s Malstrom they are survelling.  The missles there.  They already got the surveillance they were after transmitted back home.  Underground mapping of silos is complete.  Once again we are either asleep at the wheel or DOD let it happen.  Excuses after video emerged.
Sorry about the balloon that’s the last time I order from an authentic Chinese restaurant in China from Grub Hub.
Call me a Conspiracy Theorist all you want, but no way in hell am I believing a giant balloon with a sattelite strapped to it just randomly showed up from China.  Nothing about this ludicrous story makes any sense https://t.co/cRt6i4LNqn
Or that the military had no contingency plan for this type of an event 
Agreed.
Its over us now (St. Louis MO.)
I'm with you on that
Reminds me of the movie Red Dawn! The second movie where they first took out all out communications! And in the original script it was the Chinese not the North Koreans that invaded us!
Solar panels…not satellites.
There are a few radar installation sites scattered throughout Alaska, why didn’t we learn about it then as it crossed the Bering Sea.
It's preposterous
Seeing that Russian Migs have flown into NATO airspace for the last decade, it's possible
So the balloon came from China? And we’re not considering it racist to call it the Chinese spy balloon?   Does that officially mean it’s not racist to call it the China virus?
Never was
They can carry nukes
You just make too much sense?
What about Chinese takeaway .
How any the CCPS Fang Fang
Riddle me this; The United States government doesn't want to shoot the Chinese gathering intelligence balloon down because it could release debris over Montana?  China killed a million Americans with a virus from Wuhan, and they are worried about a Montana buffalo.
China didn't kill a million Americans.  Americans who wouldn't wear masks, wouldn't social distance, and wouldn't get vaccinated killed them.
Ok genius.
Please. The tech involved in their satellites can and have mapped out everything. The balloon is a mislead. It's the Hunters laptop of meaningless things in the sky to get a reaction.
Because wind is not a thing, the jet stream is not a thing, anything on or in the balloon will just fall straight down. Peach tree dish level thinking, there.
What if there's a biological weapon inside?
Don’t understand the logic of canceling trip to China. The balloon reinforces the need for the US &amp; China to send clear messages &amp; set guardrails on their relationship on issues from Taiwan to Chinese help for Russia. Blinken’s trip was meant to accomplish just this.
gop was going to savage biden et al if he proceeded with the trip and acted “weak” so he decided wasn’t worth it.
There is a lot you do not quite understand I am afraid. Enough is enough.
Hot goss!
Maybe he didn't really want to go.
China lied about the ballon.  Why trust them with this visit?
its a delay for effect, they will go later.
It's all performative diplomatic acrobatics, Richard, pure &amp; simple. Non-action, in their view, would be perceived by THE PUBLIC as a sign of weakness.  Full Stop.
Postponed not cancelled is what I've seen reported.
Blinkin is a soy boy--We do not need him speaking for the US about strength and retaliation.
You can’t have meetings when 1 party has a spy ballon making its way across the country, the talks have to wait
why would china use a spy balloon when they could just have hunter grab the info from his dads garage?
What if it is simply a weather balloon &amp; the "China"-conjecture is simply to start a world-war as a distraction from our representatives unhappy at people noticing the state of the economy?
Er…it probably is
#FoxNews The USA has equipment that would detect the Chinese Spy Balloon the minute it left China. So why did the Biden Administration ALLOW it to come this far? Why is it only being reported now? Were they hoping to hide it from the public like everything else they hide.
Yep and yep.
apparnetly in came in through Alaska, then Canada and has been over USA for several days
I just learned that there have been many spy balloons that have flown over the US we the people weren’t told about it because it is classified. Why we know about this one is above my pay grade. #shootitdown
I'm sure Biden okayed it.
Beyond reprehensible!
An except from the conversation: Joly - “What about dat der balloon from our buds in China?”
I spoke to about the security of our airspace. &nbsp; We are collaborating with our American partners and continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard Canada’s sensitive information.
Priceless 
And we’re just supposed to be okay and calm about a balloon from China floating in the sky, huh?
“The American military is on alert after a suspicious balloon from China is sighted over Montana” feels like a news story from 1895, or a sequel to Wild Wild West
Just you wait, it's gonna become a major plot point on YELLOWSTONE's next season.
Legitimately happened in the 1890s. A wave of mystery airship sightings.
Some of the headlines read like a tweet
At this point, Biden should be seen as collaborating with China by allowing their spy balloon to monitor our nuclear silos.  Don’t forget the Biden Center accepted $70 million in donations from China.   A lot of Democrats are owned by China. #Biden #FJB #FJBiden
Sad to say, but so are a bunch of #Republicans, too.
STFU LOSER.
Just gonna throw this out there. I’m 💯 certain that China launched that balloon from Canada. No other way it could have gotten there undetected.
Maybe from the rooftop of the many Communist China police Stations.
China watchin me from a balloon  now Russia tryin to steal my $SOL  just want somebody to send me some free tacos LFG  😜 https://t.co/0OD3fDDxAw
// remember when // // actually did that //
First IRL taco airdrop on Solana 
i'll be outside watching the skies, send that shit, i'm hungry
We might need to run this back
Is this the balloon from China everyone’s talking about? https://t.co/8vCddlPG4h
Haha!
saw a guy going like "it only took one missile from an f-22 to bring down the china spy balloon! wow" and I'm just like. dude. it's a balloon.
Don’t let a China hot-air balloon distract you from what’s really going on!
Can't figure out yet what they are hiding.
Too late.
The US government skyrocketing into a full blown tyranny

I should be allowed to own an F-22 to protect my family from china balloons.
WHY DID DARK BRANDON USE A SISSY F-22 INSTEAD OF AN AR-15 LIKE A REAL MAN?!?!?!
It takes a good guy with a balloon to …
Where’s my F-22 lapel pin??
If you can make the payments, it’s all yours.
You can own an F16 for $8 million as I recall
They’re just $206 million. Spare cash.
$70,000/hr to fly it...
It’s in the constitution
That is going to be a lot of Pepsi.
second amendment rights
That's what the Founders intended when they drafted the 2nd Amendment.
Is that covered under your 22 amendment ???  Just asking for us .
It's your second amendment right!!
$80,000/hr flight cost for F-22. Enjoy your new toy.
Seriously It’s an ARM! It’s literally enshrined as our God given unenviable right as written in the second amendment to the King James version of the Holy Constitution.
We should put an F-22 in every elementary school classroom!
I’m more worried about this one!
Go get it !
I want one too! #2A #2ADefenders !!!
As long as you pay for the fuel.
A Balloon is lighting up the sky above my house in the UK.
The only way to stop a bad guy with a balloon is a with a good guy with a balloon.  #ChineseSpyBalloon #BalloonControl
Yessir
A look at the data China spied on from the balloon. https://t.co/mgDcKzImCK
Don't forget all of the empty parking lots of the mattress stores that never have anyone in them but are in every strip mall lol
and future Spirit Halloween locations
"Why do they have a Ross, a Marshall's, and a Target in the same strip?!"
Debris from China's spy balloon could reach the U.S. coastline, anyone who finds it is urged to call local authorities https://t.co/bH3WzbJ5GP
I would caution that so you don’t get some kind of killer cancer like what happened to those Serbian guys recovering f117
Or a virus. I see a movie here.
Cant wait to see the analysis of the data archive
Agreed.  There’s a lot well never know.
Wouldn’t it still be like hitting concrete if it dropped into the ocean from 60,000 ft?
yes, but its not a sphere, it causes wind attrition so it will be slower than max terminal velocity + its made of steel and other stuff that can resist the impact
Probably not much steel. More likely light weight aluminum. Maybe composites to save weight.
Streamer Jordie Jordan said he was going to find wreckage and sell it. He lives 45 minutes away in Conway.
eBay, baby!
What if it’s a gender reveal
Anyone else read it as the Horny Country Police Department?  Don't lie. You did
There is a 99,999% chance the american who sees the debris will take it home.
Read that as “horny” at first!
People will be selling fake material on eBay soon.
I look forward to the selfie with China balloon debris.
Finders keepers
Nah that shits going on eBay
Most powerful military in the world....
Finders Keepers bro. First stop, eBay.
No souvenirs?
Nope!
F that,call me I got 100 on it
Bring your metal detectors to the beach for the great balloon scavenger hunt of 2023.
Finders keepers.
This is how the next pandemic will start!!!
With all of the USCG &amp; USN and SOC assets on the east coast why didn't we have recovery forces staged and in the water just after the debris splashed? Or was this going 800 mph and moving erratically?
Dibs! 
If CNN could see the Chinese Space Station or the PLA space drone--which is strikingly similar to the USSF X37B hypersonic orbital loitering munition--from the ground, in the continental USA , we would already have a (cold) war on our hands.
Next thing you know China releases balloons which float East to West across the US from a PLA navy ship in the Atlantic (or South Africa)?
It's gonna wind up on eBay.
Free satellite debris!
eBay traffic is about to go through the roof.
Already on eBay.
Oh I thought it said “Horror” county.
When China's spy balloon was shot down a statement indicated it was being retrieved, but that seems to be another US military lie.
Welp, since egg's are too expensive, I guess it's going to be the find the Chinese spy balloon hunt instead 
They can complete their retrieval on eBay 
Of course,the US military would have a recovery plan in place but have fun.
As they have done a super job to date.
Ok fed
If anyone finds the hard drive please delete videos of bare butts
Make them buy it from you
Chinese spies in America running to the Coast like.
Could have just popped the balloon. Instead you decide to destroy the entire payload. The US must be hiding something. Or.. it’s probably our spy ballon that we lost control of,..
A close up visual of the moment US shot down Chinese Spy Baloon over South Carolina with a missile fired from a F-22 Raptor.  #ChineseSpyBalloon #ChinaSpyBalloon #Balloon #ChinaBalloon https://t.co/m7HjWLdSAV
So the greatest country in the world is scared of a plastic bag full of air, 
Last image taken from China's balloon https://t.co/f9cZCF2fHC
they shot the balloon down with a missile from a jet which i feel was overkill
This has become my favorite image on the internet to describe this particular situation forever
the balloon is in the great sky in the sky now, surveying the weather with god
Great Northern, Australia's most popular piss water
Australia’s strongest soldier
he traveled all the way to south carolina to deliver the finishing blow. truly one of america’s strongest allies.
What’s the next big plan from China. ?  The 3 stooges balloon is broke.  Maybe the Trojan rabbit ?  Fuck you china
Do we even know the true purpose of the balloon ?? I'm not buying the "spy" line.
George santos ordered Chinese. doordash.  Direct ?
F’ck u and the horse u rode in on, rit? Damn balloons no how.
The balloon. Like F troop.   It is BALLOON!!!!  Remember that show ??
I just watched it for the first time! I’d never heard of it. Do u remember “The Red Balloon”? The French film?
No.   Red balloon.  Never heard of it.  Xo
So did the balloon come from china? Are we to believe that it floated over here?
I GUESS?? 
i was wondering the same. wtf does it mean? Hahaha
With surveillance and sensors?? No Ma’am
Not FLOATED
Monet for the Senate!
Ummm, you know Japan did something similar during WWII, right?
context
Its Chinese. Seen a gold sticker that said “Made in China” Whole thing is hilarious. There’s Spy gadgets like sunglasses with cameras, pens that record convos, animatronics that both record dialogue &amp; video. But they sent a giant “Get well” Balloon   Like it would go unnoticed.
I see the distraction is working
Yes, it did, and there is at least one more out there in the Southern Hemisphere   The Chinese are actually trying to do something about climate change with science, and the Western world, stuck in their short-term, political, Capitalism driven fights are like, “Not on my watch!”
did it not use the same jet streams the Japanese did in WW2?
Do you have OCULAR PROOF that it didn’t?
Yes - it's not new technology, and we use them too
I thought this tweet said ballroom. Like the culture
It's a weather ballon yall, yes it just floated here
It came from mars
They're not fooling me twice, it's Balloon Boy all over again.
Good question.  Soo from China to here no other country saw the balloon?
Girl China is a short trip away from y'all
It's a spy balloon
2020 onwards is a meme to me, like honestly wtf is this situation
Right not only that but made it all the way to Myrtle Beach 
Great question….
Gurl yes. At 100,000 feet high. Which is over twice as high as a plane.
lmaoo
Yes, that’s how balloons work. It was really, really high.
"It's black and white like a panda so it might be china" - average american

The Little Balloon That Could
It’s Julieta. They did a balloon release. She’s coming back to haunt you.
And why did they wait until the damn balloon had already made its trip across the country?! Like think of all the data it collected
People believe in crazier things, like ghosts…
What if it was a trojan horse, and by shooting it down they released some really harmful stuff? 
They finally got around to seeing Nope and were just making sure. 
No, it was people tryna play fortnite over the US
Just more fluffing to get people into the idea of going into another endless war for greed and capitalism. Look at how hard they’re reviving the red scare era fears around communism.
Girl why you tweeting this nonsense lmfao
FLOATED LMAO
Lmaoo
But I’m confused I thought we were allies
Probably launched off the west coast of Canada as it first entered U.S. over Montana.
I still don’t get why we’re scared of a balloon
no Monét it came from ancient Mesopotamia
I think it was a stray from a birthday party.
No it came from the North Pole
That's what I said.  The first sighting was over Montana.  That's a LONG mfukn way from the coast.  WTF was that b!tch before it floated there??
Can't wait for you and lady bunny to discuss this on your podcast with no real facts just conjecture 
Hunny they (US Imperialists) are just trying to do anything to create manufactured consent so that we are okay with going into a proxy war with China using Taiwan as it’s battleground. Western Psyops at its finest 
just a touch of research ms mamas 
Stop being ignorant.
JUST IN: Debris from China's spy balloon may reach the U.S. coast.   ⚠️ Anyone who finds debris should not touch it and call authorities. https://t.co/pwZm10DlUj
Why, is it contaminated with a man made bio weapon?
Fuck that, I'm selling it on eBay if I find anything with my metal detector.
I would caution that so you don’t get some kind of killer cancer like what happened to those Serbian guys recovering f117
I’ll take 4 dabloons. Finders keepers
Hunter Biden info could be in the spy balloon debris!
And cue the cover up...
Now that is hysterically funny
Lol everybody nearby is running out there to hopefully get their piece of the pie.
I’m gonna touch it, I’m gonna touch it
eBay here I come.
Hell, sell it to China. Thats what our politicians do. #ChinaSpyBalloon
Screw that, if I find some I keeping it and putting on EBay.
Full of Sarin gas?
My buddy said he’d be coming to town all the way from China in a big balloon, I hope he gets here safe and sound
Did he ever make it
Still waiting
Maybe he’s just lost. Send out a bat signal or something
condolences
I wonder if Joey Biden got permission from china to shoot the balloon down after they got the location of our nuclear silos in Montana, what a total dumbass 😂
Definitely 
It’s embarrassing!
He checked with Hunter first because he is the smartest guy he knows. I’m beginning to wonder if he thinks that because he’s comparing Hunter to all his imaginary friends. 
The fact NORAD knew it was heading towards that sensitive area in Montana, says to me they facilitated the CCP.  Well, of course they did, I know I'm preaching to the choir.
Blinken pulled back from meeting with Xi Jinping, FOX-2 from our most advanced fighter/interceptor  takes out balloon decisively and China fumbles out obvious lies. Dark Brandon is handling things like a Chief.
Was Biden concerned with upsetting his friends and Hunter’s business partners over in China when assessing the Chinese spy balloon?
You left out a part,"after allowing it to gather data all the way across the ENTIRE EFIING NATION!" There, fixed it.
Lol he can never be viewed as a chief of anything. This was orchestrated by Biden and China to try and repair his neglectful duty to America. Who knows what the balloon was carrying.
China creates silly balloon drama. Millions of morons addicted to TikTok create content about it. China gathers even more intel from it. The end.
America surrounds China with military bases. America freaks out about one drifting balloon from China. America is one psychopathic sociopathic cancer on humanity.

China owns our government.
Images from the China spy balloon have started coming in. #china #Balloon #ChinaBalloon #spyballoon https://t.co/ED6dFmRUYa
Is it racist to call it a “china balloon or balloon from china” as it was with “china virus”? Just checking what is politically correct this week, I don’t want to be considered racist.
Thank you to the men and women of the United States military who were responsible for completing the mission to shoot down the Chinese surveillance balloon.  The Biden Administration did the right thing in bringing it down.
Did the right thing? It took way too long. They already collected all the info they needed. We showed weakness, just like you! Weak rino sellout! You shouldn’t be representing We the People!
Took a day to respond, meanwhile Trump took half a year to lift a finger on Covid. Y’all have an interesting sense of urgency depending on who it allows you to dunk on.
Words have explicit and implicit meaning. I think humans can aspire to use the ones that build connection rather than needlessly harm.
Why fo u need to put a nationality to a freaking balloon.  I hope u are joking.
Who's calling it a "China ballon?" People who barely speak English?

President Joe Biden speaks to reporters about the weather balloon from China that was shot down: “On Wednesday when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible,” on the tarmac in Hagerstown, Maryland on Saturday. https://t.co/RMSvrbtxVM
Insane joe
Just proves that Biden is not the commander-in-chief
You’re a journalist? All reports say it is spy balloon and you are saying weather balloon, why are you promoting CCP’s narratives
There’s nothing to recover from the spy balloon. The missile hit the only section we NEEDED to recover to know exactly what China got https://t.co/uTwDZkAFq6
Sir, I have been a lifelong supporter from 1988 to 2008 to now. But with your hesitation to shoot down the China Balloon, it is clear you are simply unfit for office. Retire in 2024. We need a strong President who can stand up to China: like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer!
We’ve created more manufacturing jobs than any president at this point in the last 40 years.    This is what it looks like to reinvest in communities that’ve been forgotten for too long.
Bahahaha
You lost me on the first sentence.  Boy are you a dupe.
I do not know if I would vote for Whitmer over Biden in a primary, but I would vote for Whitmer over any far left Democrat and any Republican.
Why was it racist to call Covid the China flu when we knew it came from China but it's not racist to call the balloon the China balloon when we're even less sure where it came from 🤔
One has plausible deniability other does not. If you wanted to spend $ you could get satellite photos from someone like that show the exact origin of the balloon. USA govt has 24hr continuous playback of the entire globe. All of it recorded. 100% Chinese balloon.
My suspicion is that it probably had more to do with the US political climate then vs now. Was there really any debate that first cases occurred in Wuhan?
Also because one is just a machine and the other is a pathogen carried by humans. The latter can lead to prejudice much more easily than the former.

Omae wa mou shindeiru
What's even more whack is that covid-19 was (to the best of my knowledge) created in a lab at Wuhan, and there's been 0 action taken by the international community.
Very wack
If you're curious, the issue isn't that calling COVID 'china flu' is racist, it's that racist people blame ethnic Chinese living in their country for the virus. This is why, globally, the WHO has stopped identifying viruses by where they were first identified.
You're statistically wrong, but at least you're loud about it.  also don't shoot the messenger
Okay. Appreciate your response.
To call Covid the China flu is not racist. Who said it is?
Is your PFP an Angel from Evangelion?
Whether you call it racist or not, it still results in an increase in violence towards Americans who look like they may be Chinese. So let’s stop.
Still racist
We all know that but our opinion doesn’t matters. It’s blown down by US govt any ways
Statement from Canada's defence minister: Today, the United States took definitive action to bring down China’s high-altitude surveillance balloon that has violated U.S. and Canadian airspace and international law.  https://t.co/QaYvqhuJtU https://t.co/44NdeFCu9m
Figures Canada would defer to their CCP Master.
Yeah except it DIDN’T ensure the “security and defense of North American air sovereignty.”
Not like Trudeau would do anything he’s funded by the ccp
TLDR…”our fighter jet was over in Newfoundland and the missile we have is in the shop for repairs, so we couldn’t do anything”.
So why didn’t our Air Force shoot it down for the multiple days it was in Canadian airspace prior to crossing into American?  Once again our govt never takes defence seriously and requires the Americans to do everything for us.
To late, should have been BEFORE it hit the continent
Wondering out loud!!! Why did CANADA not take action when the balloon was over our country and specifically my home region. Canada is supposed to be the first line of defence in NORAD. What happened and why were Canadians not informed.
Today ladies and gentlemen the United States of America bravely confronted the challenge from China. It shot down a weather balloon   God bless America
Shit! That means China won’t get any weather!
Serves em right, trying to intimidate the US with balloons
You can't possible believe it was a weather balloon. Surely if the Chinese need to know what the weather is like in USA they can switch on CNN.
Fair enough. But the Chinese also have sophisticated spy satellite technology. Why would they need a balloon?
I really can’t believe, that story was the main item today on BBC News, I guess it kept England getting beat by Scotland off the headlines?
Why did the Biden Administration wait so long to shoot the balloon down?
I know this is hard for you to understand Hanan, but shooting it down over a populated area could lead to injuries and or death.  Try to think with your brain next time.
Critical thinking is hard when all you do is talk shit.
it kept crossing timezones…  ‘WHERED IT GO!?’ ‘EASTERN!’ ‘aahh f***’
To make sure it was safe to shoot down.
Because they didn’t want people o the ground to get hurt, as most adults, children and house plants can understand with no difficulty.
Explains why we didn't shoot down over Alaska
We didn't want degrees to fall all over densely populated areas like Alaska, and Montana. #psyop
I’m guessing it might’ve had something to do with the Joint Chiefs. Whatever the reason it’s way above both your pay grade and level of personal intelligence.
I’m sure next time they’ll ask you to weigh in
Ocean?
To make sure the falling debris didn’t land on civilians.
After watching the Afghanistan evacuation I doubt Biden’s handlers are concerned about a few casualties.
They hadn't run out of hot air yet
They waited for it to be over water so nobody got hurt. It's really not that complicated.
The only President in recent history that was preemptively involved in helping the American people is
You just made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.  “Shudder”
Why are you so scared of a balloon
Not the balloon. The owners of the balloon.
Let's just wait a week for the #ChineseSpyBalloon to spy on our entire country, and then we will shoot it down.  you're and absolute #embarrassment to #America and to the rest of the world!!! #BidenWorstPresidentEver
Hmmm... April 2019, Trump took no action for that Balloon China sent. This latest balloon was huge, and the military blocked it from gathering electronic data and distorted the visuals, while gathering as much operational data on the test as they could. https://t.co/bFN0WfH2m8
So Biden is shooting only after it already gathered all our data. Brandon fails again, Get rid of this liability of a President. 
Meme are your proof?
Look at all the liberals trying to deflect to Trump and normalize Chinese spy balloons… And they call MAGA and cult…..
Far more logical than anything else I've read on twitter ballooning today 
Where and when? No unnamed sources
You’re more concerned that a spy balloon happened under the Trump administration rather than what’s happening now?  The Obama/Biden administration had one as well but you just mention Trump.  Hmmmm….
Rent free moron.
Hmmm the military blocked it from gathering data yep sounds like trump's orders
Glad that we finally knocked Communist China's spy balloon out of the sky.   Now, needs to explain why he tried to hide Chinese espionage from Congress and the American people. What else is he not telling us?
I ordered a balloon from china last week. I hope it arrives ok.
Friggin just got a text from my mom letting me know they shot down the China balloon here, despite being half asleep it woke me right up.
BREAKING!   CHina's Spy balloon was shot down at 2:40 PM Eastern Time over the Atlantic Ocean not far from Myrtle Beach.  Video of the balloon sinking from 60, 000 feet did not show any debris falling from the balloon.   Your thoughts... https://t.co/8BkJie3r5s
There were alerts before it was over our land. WHY did it take so long for a decision to destroy it?
They said they didnt shoot it down to protect civilians on the ground.  What would they do if it was a military plane?
It’s about time. It never should have taken this long. It’s like this administration wants China to get a good look at look the American interior.
Glad he did it ...finally! Why did he wait so long? Let's hope that this isn't the start of something worse?
I hoped they were able to recover it.
There’s wide expanses of unpopulated land in Montana and throughout the north/mid west. Why wasn’t it shot down over these areas?
Looked like a big car airbag going poof.
My thoughts are that enough data was collected and sent back to China, that it didn’t matter if it was finally shot down. Damage was already done. It showed the world how vulnerable our country is &amp; how easy it was for China to enter our air space.
Good 
Now...98 more luftballoons? (Go by, go bye?)
Chinese remotely ejected the sensor array over the ocean before it was shot down.
#DontMessWithTheUS
Never should have entered U.S. air space. our Military and our President Failed Big time!
What if it was not a spy balloon, but rather a clever biological weapon that would deploy when the balloon was destroyed? Wouldn't we feel silly to have dropped it on ourselves?
Look at the video again. Plenty of debris
The American public (via media) should never have heard a word about this. National defense doesn't engage in media hypes. Embarrassing.
There goes Gen. Milley's stance of too much debris. He should've known this. Probably too busy learning about  'white rage' and finding the next book on CRT for the Army cadets at West Point. Or maybe there's an underlying reason of such a weak delayed reaction being spied upon..
I am so angry. He waited to have the balloon shot down AFTER the Chinese had all the info they wanted. He is so corrupt and obviously he is in the pocket of the Chinese. Also made sure we were unable to gain any info from the balloon. He needs to be impeached for being China agen
I must say that with all the satellites hovering over our earth moving at 16-17,000 mph, the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans and the Iranians all have the most current footage of every inch of American soil possible. This was a reactionary test to see what we would do..
And we failed miserably!!!
I have another one, but not car related.  "He shot down the China Balloon with an AR-15 from the top of the Chrystler building."
QOTD: Name a car-related accomplishment George Santos bragged about.
Successfully completed the Snake River Canyon jump a month before Evel Knievel attempted it.
Trump let the Chinese spy balloon float around the US with no issues . Biden stopped the balloon from transmitting and he took it down. Who is owned by China?
Side by side from and his wife Elizabeth  https://t.co/m8BIt0i9Fa
BREAKING: Chinese Spy Balloon Shot Down Over South Carolina- Chad Caton Caught It Live  "Hey China, kiss my a**... Holy sh*t, that just happened" -
Hey Chinese Spy balloon is chilling in our air space!! This administration says it’s cool!! Is this not treason?? Let’s let WeThePeople decide!!
Chad Caton is a rock star. Definitely worth following if you're not already.
Another angle of the CCP Spy Balloon being shot down.  Credit to wife Elizabeth
China needed the spy balloon to traverse entire nation so as to get pics of all our bases and defenses.  And we all know China gets what it wants from Joe Biden.
my thoughts exactly...but how much did he n Hunter make off the deal?
How do we know the balloon was from China?
They will say that all evidence of spying  China 🇨🇳  balloon was destroyed like Hillary Clintons e mails from the war head blast.
All video from our coverage of the China spy balloon being shot down here in Myrtle Beach SC.
#BREAKINGNEWS: #ChineseSpyBalloon #ShotDown by missile fired from F22 Raptor fighter jet flying from Langley Air Force Base. According to #Pentagon officials the purpose of #China's balloon was to monitor strategic military sites across the United States.  https://t.co/vF5871uk7H
After investigating the balloon debris, military experts are saying that its source wasn't China, it was from a gender reveal party in Dubai.
TFG trumps Chinese balloons were payment reminders from China bank https://t.co/uzfgB3XpWp
Bank accounts plus everything he wears and his family businesses products are made in China . What a con man and family as well .
Apparently, spy balloons from China have been inserted throughout the country.  #spyballoon #Balloon #ChineseSpyBalloon #Chinese #MedTwitter #UroTwitter https://t.co/UmFOmy6a00
AH man's foley is legend
You do have a great imagination.
When you talk about America, remember you're talking about a Hollywood indoctrinated society that lives in complete isolation from the rest of the world, believes in all types of extraterrestrial phenomena like spy balloons, UFOs, flying saucers &amp; alien invasion. #China #Balloon https://t.co/C0DU9myJb3
War on "unidentified high-altitude objects"    Do you know the hysteria behind the shooting down of these "unidentified high-altitude objects"?   Answer: To make up for the poor balloon shoot down performance. And so shooting down unseen objects is just a US public remedy.
during cold war aliens turned yankkk nukes off and Soviet ones on
Somali Institute of Chinese Propaganda.
As an American I am horrified by the levels of ignorant hateful nonsense here.
Pictures from China balloon be like https://t.co/He9W9Pq3Lu
The China Balloon distracted the MSM from Biden's documents scandal
Trump didn't shoot down the 3 Chinese balloons that passed over the US during his term because he was afraid that China would call in his huge loan from them. He was compromised!
must be true I read it on the internet!
After the China balloon, it's obvious the only thing keeping our homeland safe from invasion is the armed U.S. citizen.
Truth bomb
Exactly
GOP: Chinese Spy Balloon!!!!!!!  GOP: Oh, sh*t,... Biden blocked it from sending intel, swiped China's intel, shot it down safely &amp; in a way to recover and analyze it... AND trump let 3 balloons surveil US without telling the public or doing anything...  GOP: Socialism!!!!!!! https://t.co/GU6tZeReyV
"Information suggesting that Chinese spy balloons traveled over the continental United States during the Trump administration was 'discovered after' former President Trump left office" -- Senior Biden Official
China would have probably shot down our balloon immediately without any regard to the lives of their people or property damage from the fallen debris. America protects its own. #spyballonbust
Biden Sniffs children  Strokes their hair Touches their breasts Forces a Chinese Bioweapon into the arms of kids Takes Billions of dollars from China Destroys America's Economy Is a Puppet for Globalists A Traitor  And now the Balloon? What's this dude gotta do to get Impeached?
Talk on the phone
hell no i dont want to talk to any one
Trump talked on the phone, got impeached... Apparently Biden doesn't.. LOL I hate phones.
It's incredible 
It worked in the past...
maybe he's that fkr pennywise
Forgot the 5 million illegal invaders...sworn to protect all enemies foreign and domestic...so much for that...
Crazy part is this is just a small portion over the last few years.
Is it even him--
Shower with his daughter?
Most of our leaders aren't going for impeachment because they are in on the grift   and the fleecing of America thru Ukraine. Our two party system  is there to divide us, and blind us to the truth and many other grifts....
I have asked this question for over two years now.
Great question…It’s the sniffing part that I find really disturbing, and the fact he armed the taliban with 83b of military machinery and left his own troops to die..what a low act..
apparently you’re confused. the father of the jabs just said his jabs are saving millions of lives
He had to wait until the Republicans took over the House
Preach it girl !!!!!!!!! PREACH
clone/reptilian..
Apparently, a lot. WWIII will end his reign, however. 
Ask the fake news ... oh wait
Change his name to Trump?
Disobey the deep state
Don’t forget the invasion at our border!!
And just released a senior Muslim terrorist.....
Change to republican...
The swamp runs deep over here.
Where is the trial and the noose?
Die...
He's literally just going to step aside and not run in 2024.
#BidenCrimeFamilyExposed
Drain the swamp that floats his boat.
Nothing will happen to these CTS and no one is going save us.
You forgot to mention he's also a Zionist who whitewashes #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliTerrorism #IsraeliOccupation #IsraeliApartheid
I don’t blame him…evil will be evil…where is the military? Looks like will be 1776 again .
That's the short list
Amen!
If he switched parties, he'd get impeached.
Impeach Biden , Harris Steps Up Pardons Biden , The Biden Gets Off Scott Free , No Thanks ? #SpeakerJohnny
Don't forget the open border, theft of classified docs and the equal parts deadly and humiliating Afghanistan withdrawal/multi-billion dollar weapons transfer to terrorists.  It's like he figures if he commits every possible impeachable act, nobody will know what to focus on.
Don’t forget he armed the Taliban with more than 300,000 guns but wants to take our away!!
The swamp traitors' actions and corruption are being exposed to gather evidence and wake up the sheeple - Military tribunals kate summer 2023 will bring them down
Hes a puppet actor following orders
Pick a better VP
Don't forget the border.
And he is senile.
You do understand that you know absolutely not a damn thing about the China balloon or what it obtained- you’re just a little twitter boy pretending you have knowledge from within- when will you be adding your 🇨🇳 to your profile?
Biden handled the Chinese Spy Balloon flawlessly. The Pentagon was able to collect data from the Chinese balloon while simultaneously preventing the balloon from gathering US data. He ignored the cries from Marjorie Greene and Jim Jordan -- and the country is safer because of it.
Flawlessly destroyed a Chinese spy balloon after it toured the US for days. 
You do understand that the balloon didn't get any information.
Trump hid his Chinese bank account  Hid the fact that he paid more in taxes in China than at home  Hid the fact that 3 Chinese balloons infiltrated our airspace during his admin  Hid the fact that Covid was coming &amp; was gonna be bad  Traitor hid this shit from us &amp; got us killed
Always putting himself above our nation  Incessantly putting his real estate deals above our nat’l security  Constantly putting his political interests above our republic  Consistently putting his wallet above our homeland security  The most selfish conman to ever walk this earth
Trumpity Trump Trump Trump. Wow!
You got your facts wrong about the three prior balloons.  Now, even the intelligence community is not saying that.  At most, they are saying that, after Trump left office, they came to believe that.  You are spreading falsehoods that no one with actual knowledge claims.
Trump knew and his ego prevented him from doing the correct, professional thing
Perhaps you should have some knowledge or expertise before spreading falsehoods.
Well this is propaganda with very little fact. Mostly just warped opinions on what happened with a baseline of truth and that's it. You are not better when you act the same as the team you claim to hate. You're just on a different side...
Traitor at birth
Include his Russian and Turkish illegal monies!
When does he get what’s coming to him???! Goin on tooooooo long!
Trump single-handedly caused the US Covid pandemic. If his administration had started a response in Nov-Dec 2019, when they first learned of it, it could have been prevented. His denial led to little action until Rudy Gobert Day, March 11, three months too late.
OMG. Do Magas have to take a test to be elected. Unbelievable disconnect with reality
The balloon was tRUmp-tax funded.
I have a bank account in China too, that's not illegal.   China also doesn't have a 4000 page tax code, full of loopholes, like the USA.  The balloons were visible from the ground, how exactly do you think he hid them?
And those are a few things we know he did. How about all the stuff we don’t know about that he hid and got away with!
Or wantonly let us die with unrestrained glee 
Your hatred of Trump is harming your cause.  It is wasted effort; he is a spent force.
We know!!!! Someone should tell the DOJ!!!!!
Traitors All.
Don’t forget that he sold them the largest order of soy beans, corn and beef our nation has ever seen while Americans where in food lines because of the pandemic. And he only got a third of the deal.
Also this:
You're missing on this published list but we know what you are.  Paid shill.
Well, not too brag got approved for SNAP. TY POTUS. The relief of that. The work I've done to get here. Still short on food, etc.   But, this battle current is over ........ At least until July......    Now rent, water, and renter's insurance.....
No balloons ever entered the air space under trump. Confirmed today.
Wait how did anyone get killed? Once again my favorite parody account
The love of money is the root of all evil.
More propaganda.
Uncle intel?
did he pay what he owed tax wise in our country???
Proof?
Blah, Blah, Blah!
Yes he did!!! Indict Trump now!!!!!
Believe him….
The covid part is the horror story here. Unforgivable   Not that seeks it.
He got the Covid fact in a phone call from Xi Jinping, the dictator with whom he "fell in love"  Chinese spies were flooding Mar-a-Lago around 2019, Secret Service said they "gave up" trying to control the situation
Please show your source evidence for these claims.
Shocking, not from TFG
Damn! I knew he had a bank acct, didn’t know he paid more taxes there than here, but we’re in inverse world now.
You peddling falsehoods! It’s retraction time!
TFG with the orange complexion s/b behind bars in an orange jumpsuit wither Secret Service protection 24/7!!
Check recent news from the big guy's administration.
And you believe this? 
These are not facts.
DOJ not Justice
bad vocab... LINDY..... and in accurate= FAKE !
and Ronny Jackson is his fluffer
Any proof?
This fan fiction?
Hid the fact that he never really donated his salary like he said he would.
Where did Covid start, huh???
Oh you’re still alive and well. No need to be dramatic over the sniffles.
You’re not a good liar. All of that has already been debunked.
You spelt biden wrong....
Yes, and burnt the pandemic instruction booklet left by Obama leaving himself to fumble at every critical point
Typical lying leftist with zero credibility, groomer
I had an account in China, in fact I never closed it before I left.   I paid taxes there too.  Pretty easy to pay more there than here.   No biggie
This aged well
And that doesn’t even compare to all the Russia stuff he hid.
I think it's crazy how Trump hid 3 Chinese Spy Balloons flying in America.   He must have convinced Americans not to look up. Maybe it happened during those COVID lockdowns when nobody was technically supposed to go outside.
Here, isn’t this yours?
So are you implying you are dead?
You don't really believe that
Have you noticed that a war erupted in Europe because there is a weak president in the USA.
Wow. How is it you're still tweeting?
And he’s running again for president because nobody has the cahonjes to stand up to him and put an end to this
I hope you're wearing hip waders, as you are knee deep right now.
And Russian collusion was real…….. #Dreamer
general miley admitted that they never told trump about the balloons
In England - treason is a hangable offence
If you've no proof, this isn't free speech, it's called slander
You have this unhealthy fascination with Trump I see.
Your the traitor to everything
Your huge lies are treasonous.
You have no proff of that your spewing lies again
He's a lying cheat. We know this. Deprogram the CULT that is Republicanism!
Correction: a top military general announced today they hid that from Trump.  Will you issue a retraction or do you not possess such integrity?
Literally every part of that is a lie . Not one aspect of truth. Holy crap girlfriend
What are your sources as I know one of your listed items is a % outright lie.
Do you have any proof of the 3 balloons? No one else seems to.
Oooooooo oh nooooooooo. !!!!!!
A clear and present danger… and his Comitying Crimes Against Humanity. Every Covid sufferer should sue the damn pants off of him.
And yet here you are posting crap on a minute by minute basis.  Doesn’t appear he was very effective does it?
There's no way people can read this and not see pure disingenuous BS.
A lot of mis-information. Balloons were silly and unimportant yesterday morning, covid was in the US in Fall 2019 and I am still alive as you are so we weren't killed.
Still talking about Trump years after he left office....
I love it when you go off your meds. You are sooooo crazy. You go girl! LOL!
Pelosi got a briefing about covid, then went to China town for Lunar New Year and called Trump a racist for restricting flights from China. Then chose to spend House time and resources on a hopeless impeachment while the first positives were showing up.
I bet you have a few Chinese bank accounts...
This is a TDS parody account right… right?
Stop spreading Chinese propaganda...
Lindy Li. Paid Idio* shill
There's only one thing worse than a Liar.   You are a God damned LIAR.
Biden hid Hunter paying $49,000  a month rent to the big guy for a house that would garner $5000 on the open market.  Verified by Pompeo no balloons entered US on Trumps watch  Such an ugly woman Li is on the inside and out.
Bless your heart!! The Demoncrat koolaid you’ve been drinking has stunted your common sense cells!!
All lies. Congrats
Are you alive?
Gaslighting again? You toss around pseudo-facts (lies) around more than your idol #LyinBiden
Trump deserves Criticism. We all know that now you are spewing lies. The pentagon today clarified their comments and said they didn’t know about the balloons until after trump left office. Trump, his sec of defense, cia director and 2 directors of DNI denied the claim.
You have Trump on the brain. Het a life.
More lies!
The story about 3 balloons is a fake. You know it or would not have felt the need to make this post to deflect from that fact.  Do you seriously believe that something like 3 Chinese spy balloons over America on Trumps watch would have gone unnoticed by the media?
You people and your conspiracy theories! Smh
why are you allowing lies from communist china spy
Chinese spy balloons over US during Trump admin 'discovered after' he left office: senior Biden official
This is all lies and you know it or you would not be posting it. No one but left wing sheep that is. Your a disgrace to America and a joke, plain and simple
These sentiments bought and paid for by Act Blue
You have completely derailed.
It appears that maybe he was one person short!
Zzzzzzzz yawn…
Remember all the investigations into Trump and how they ask have resulted in nothing? What ever happened with his tax returns that were released recently? Keep grasping at those plastic straws but one day you'll realize you are the problem.
Oh the war mongering we will go! Who cares about police brutality, starving children in the streets, or people who can barely feed their families, when it is all about war!
Didn't you say that Biden is your favorite president? Aren't you very grateful to him?
Why don’t you focus on Hunter Biden’s $1.5 Bil China hedge fund he secured on a trip to China w his VP father-corrupt China Fentanyl Biden?
If Trump hid the fact that 3 Chinese balloons infiltrated our airspace then how did you find out?
The Queen of mindless drivel - every time.
my name is lindy, and I love joe Biden.
molests little kids , China sends the Biden’s 4 little boys a week for him to molest and sniff
He’s not the president. You love him more than his voters do. You never stop talking about him.
How are you tweeting this if you’re dead?
Wait wait wait this is too good... you are now blaming Trump for China's tax code...
Ok China
Stop with the fake shit. We have real issues under the CURRENT President
Got it wron .Hunter Biden had dealings with Chinese and Ukraine    remember laptop has all the evidence. Proven you are lying about the   Chinese  Ballons came over when Trump admin was in office ,Esper,Grinell,Radcliff and Pompea said it never happenedanother llie Dr Fauci  lied
Regarding the importance of accuracy none of your foolish talking points about Trump are recognizable versions of the truth. You'll be happier in the long run if you focus on the benefits of being truthful.
TDS..
why are liberals still hung up on Trump
I guess you missed the “revised” narrative coming from the pentagon. DoD now saying there were balloons flying over the US during Trump admin, but they didn’t find out until after he left office. ?!?!  You would have to be a  to believe any of this at this point.
He didn’t hide his bank account…it was on his taxes. He didn’t hide what he paid to china, again, on his taxes. He paid what he owed to both countries. Our loopholes allowed him to pay less. No laws were broken! And the balloon story just isn’t true. Democrat propaganda!
Are you 100% sure.  Im gonna need proof.
are the intelligence officials who are saying 3 chinese balloons infiltrated the US under Trump the same officials that claimed Hunter's laptop was planted by the Russians as part of a disinformation campaign?
Life is sooo good under.biden gas prices up food prices up rent up utilities up inflation thru the roof yep.biden  so much better than trump NOT!
lol, you need to research and not just listen to CNN
Get your facts straight
FACT: The Bidens are the first First Family to have formally been in business w communist nuclear power/enemy, the People's Republic of China. When Biden took office, his son Hunter still held a 10% stake in a Chinese investment fund, BHR, which is controlled by the Bank of China
Stop tweeting proven lies
So I have info from multiple trump cabinet that there were no chinese weather balloon incidents during his administration.   Please reply with proof otherwise or I need to assume you are a fake news propagandist
Then how did more Americans die of Covid during the Biden administration than that of the Trump administration????
So.... just a quick question..... if all of these things are hidden, why do you know about them?
Hey Karen, apologize, this is bullshit.
When you say ‘Trump paid more taxes in China than America’, what kind of taxes are you talking about?  Income taxes?  Property taxes?  Business taxes?  Are you comparing business taxes in China to income taxes from the years he was president and had a reduced income?
And 2  shows the TRUMP CARD And The Apprentice both got cancelled!
So PREDICTABLE!
Lord Trump.. I sure miss him.. Greatest President ever..
Biden hid the fact that the balloon was over the country.  Biden hid the fact that Hunter was working with Chinese and Ukrainian companies to make money using Clueless Joe's status.
Wow there are so many Nazi Maga Russian troll bots in the comments. You are really  irritating them. Good job!
If that was correct  you buttholes on the left  would be all over criticizing when Trump  was still president
You never produce receipts… you are just full of …
Can't believe Democrats force you to work on Sunday.
Liar liar pants on  You libs are a joke!! Hence, why the country looks like a circus on crack.
At your full of s*** and when you do business overseas you have bank accounts in those countries
If it were not for trump you would have no platform.  When Biden and his admin screws up you select with Trump.  You are an angry little troll.
Imagine what Biden hiding right?
You’re the traitor, your Chinese it was your balloon. It was your Covid.
He was an international businessman, of course he's going to have international bank accounts. He paid taxes in China because he did business there. He paid taxes here as well and broke no laws. Stop crying. It's pathetic.
Come on ahole!
Just making it up. Let’s talk abt what Biden has hidden. Hunter used Joe to make Bidens MILLIONS selling out our country. Biden lied abt laptop. Biden used FBI DOJ IRS to target opposition. Biden targeted social media cos via Fed Govt to suppress Biden left American n Kabul
Biden hid his Chinese bank account.  There I fixed it for you.
Wait til you find out how many millions of dollars Biden has been paid by China! For years.
Haha. You’re so funny, Lindy Li!  Don’t forget he kicks puppies.   You so funny.
your not a very gracious immigrant, ladies don't curse, much to learn about America
This is better 
You call him a traitor! How about state thats your opinion, last time I checked he beat every impeachment, and has never been brought to trial or convicted as a traitor!! People like you are a problem.
Thx , Chinese sell out!
ps - Stop Lying!   COVID came form the the Wuhan Lab.. with Fauci's Help.. NOT from Trump.. Wake UP!!!
Spreading misinformation and disinformation isn’t sophisticated.
This propaganda on Chinese balloons needs to stop.
Who are you!!!
Who are u!!!
Wow he hid it so well, that you can tell us all about it, wow he did a great job.  pfffffffffffffffffffffffffft
#MOREBULLSHIT
Lmfao.
You really need to step away from CNN! Had to have a Chinese account for his business there. If there were any balloons, they were undetected per Biden’s people. You know what that word means. Right?
I smell downright lunacy in your tweets
China hid Covid from the entire world and allowed a huge festival to take place even though they knew Covid would spread worldwide due to the massive festival. Direct your anger at the origins and stop being transparently biased and selective with your memory.
The propoganda account isn't even hiding the fact that it is desperately attempting to change the narrative away from its own role in the COVID plandemic.
I'm so tired of your commentaar, Chinese bot!!!
And now it looks like the vaccine may be killing people!
Any evidence of what you posted?
We saw what he did
We know sll about Trump bank accounts and not a fan. But he was nit told at all and Biden was not told immediately. That is biggest concern.
let me guess...you not only still believe in the Trump/Russia hoax but likewise still 100% in on the COVID hoax?    Hilarious.
哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈，去了美国脑子也没了
Bull💩. What did he do to the China balloons flying over the us while he was potus? Shoot them down?  Hell no. He HID it from Americans. He lied to Americans about covid. He can’t be trusted. PERIOD. … Really
Trump is the ONLY person who can stop China. He’s the ONLY person who can END the war in Ukraine. If you want PEACE across the world, VOTE TRUMP IN 2024!!
and don't forget to mention that while everyone was focused of the china balloon you freed a 911 terrorist planner from gitmo, you are a TRAITOR!
From pubic military sources. We learned as much or more information about China’s surveillance balloon as they did.  We effectively jammed their capacity to get information. Biden decision was judicious and in the end we will recover the hardware without any one being injured!
BREAKING: In retaliation for President Biden shooting down the spy balloon, China announced it will cancel #DonaldTrump from receiving his gift toaster oven for opening a new Chinese bank account. https://t.co/XVUOvpLiA6
Indeed it does !! Our military from the Pentagon to the rest of our military departments have become woke and afraid, that is why it took so long to act up on that spy China balloon, the following picture speak a volume of our current military. Need to change. https://t.co/MVtDHbs8eC
in a tizzy over China balloon that Biden had shot down.  Three time during Trump admin China sent balloons across the country. Trump did nothing! From their reaction looks like they are backing China. To the this is America love it or leave it!
Maybe China is starting to piss me off a bit. WHY?  IF covid DID in fact come from China, their bullshit in Taiwan and now this balloon crap, they need to cut out the fucking garbage and get their house in order.
Maybe? Cuz u sound solid!! N this theory started as trump lost/ covid  began n ukrain bombed! real news!! 
China seems to be a developing story.  I guess time will tell for all of this.  The verdict is in on Trump, he's guilty as charged.  Treason.
I have NO sorrow or emotion left for him! he is  no one of concern to me!!! But our country- i deeply want Fixed n him put in jail!
They've been building at least 119 missile silos, first reported June 2021. Think they have big plans for us.
They claim that the balloons were a message to us that America is in decline. It may take years to recover from tRumpism, but at least Biden’s first moves were to undo the damage that tRump had done. And “made in America” sounds better than “made in China.”
imao, China is a huge country &amp; population - it is facing many domestic crises and so i agree they need (for their own sake) get those things in order.  one main reason USA is currently strong in the world is our domestic economy.  and, we need to tax corps. &amp; the rich though ~
If China balloon was on an intelligence mission, my guess is they found precious little of it:   #TheGreatAmericaShow US Military Fears China May Reach Balloon Debris Before They Can Get There-U.S. Salvage Vessel Won't Be There For Days https://t.co/znK25XalSj via
That’s why it didn’t over fly DC, looking  for intelligence.
Our government is a joke
What?  It’s right off our east coast.  Many military bases there.
They found more flying over America's heartland than they would have ever found in DC.
Come on, it's right outside Charleston Naval base.
Idiots
I guess we got CCP Naval vessels that have been already off our coast.
How is that even possible?
Fishing boats could retrieve today.  Military is pathetic.
Is the debris in our territorial waters?
Inexcusable. It's right off the US coast and on the opposite side of the world for China.
I’m sure it was transmitting info as it flew over 
Then just park the navy around the debris field and wait
China told the OBiden administration, leave the balloon alone , China will recover it! OBiden said ! YES SIR XI .
7miles off the coast is within the territorial waters of the USA. China cannot be allowed to be there.
So, we had a week to take it down, and we can't get Navy assets in the debris field before the Chinese get there?  We are really sucking as a nation right now.
China has they don't need stinking balloon 
It just gets more embarrassing.
Comrades, I was able to take a break from hollering about the China Balloon to appear on this tv show with a very unhealthy looking convicted criminal and a white nationalist QAnon promoter. We discussed things that do not matter to Montanans! https://t.co/GMa7KA39Bu
Trump tried to deny reports on Sunday that China launched spy balloons over the U.S. during his presidency. But he was lying as usual.
For the MAGATs demanding proof
“The Defense Department has notified Congress of several previous incursions of U.S. airspace by Chinese surveillance balloons, with earlier sightings near Texas, Florida, Hawaii and Guam, U.S. officials said Sunday.”
“Donald Trump Tries to Deny That Spy Balloons Also Flew Over U.S. During His Presidency"
He couldn’t even keep Chinese spies out of his own Mar-a-Lago! 
now do
I believe him. No one told him anything because they didn’t trust him.
Unlike the unnamed Pentagon 'sources', both Ratcliffe and Grennell have publicly denied it. nice try
Of course DJT was lying. That’s his MO. “Chinese spy balloons cross into the US 3 times during the Trump administration, Pentagon officials say.”
Trump tolerated PRC surveillance balloons traversing North America to protect his business and banking interests in China. In addition to White House Advisor Ivanka's lucrative Chinese voting machine trademarks, Ivanka probably also invested in PRC surveillance balloon patents.
prove it
Biden corruption can't be separated from his China balloon national defense catastrophe.
Just add it to the pullout from Afghanistan, and his funding the war in Ukraine.  He's doing great.
We need our borders closed now for safety risk to Americans and America 
This is hilarious Xs a million hilarious'  A seditious conspirator thinks because he advised trump he has access to highly sensitive classified Intel 
Tom's life can be summed up in one word.. SAD
Service dodger says what?
Nice blush Tom….  My sister asked for her make bag back
Maybe MILLY VANILLY hid it from him?
Ok, now it’s a National defense catastrophe? Do tell… 
Many of us are, especially since the huffington post was involved.
T.R.E.A.S.O.N.
The chain of command failed. Military leadership cannot be trusted. Reduce $31T in debt by reducing the Pentagon budget.
Tom, who is actually running our country?  Do we know who the real puppet-master is behind the curtain?
Wouldn’t be surprised if he got permission from the #chinese before having it shot down.
Frivolous Fitton is a charlatan and a hack, sloppy fake lawyer desperate for fascism

Chinese and Russian spies.
Why are you so dumb?
How many pancakes does it take to shingle a Dog House? 14 cause ice cream don't have bones..
General Mattis knew about balloons flying over the United States when Trump was President and he didn't inform the President of the United States of America or the head of ODNI? Who else did they not inform?
If it wasn’t for these two Montana Patriot Journalists. We Americans would not have known of this Chinese Spy Balloon! They physically saw it with a telescopic Photographer lense. Until they saw &amp; reported it. It was left unreported!
I guess this is how they knew the spy balloon came from china. https://t.co/Nd7fMnimrQ
That and the one with Hunter Biden hanging from it could possibly be the meme of the year and it’s only February
Hey Stew, as an Irishman who's following you for the last 3 years. Love your work exposing the bio weapon  I would love if you could interview   we all need to work together to reach a much larger wiser audience.  I'm gonna keep trying #Followthesilenced
rumours confirm those red letters were applied by a super-secret (but now you know) autonomous drone that intercepted said balloon over the Aleutian Islands and used remote control to add obvious graffiti, complete w/ phonetic spelling too.
BARROON!!! 
ok this one is funny stewie :D
Yeah, the snake venom in the water told them.
That probably would have been written by a Japanese person.   Still, very funny, I actually laughed out loud.
I'm wondering why they kept saying it was from China? Did I miss the flag?
Here I thought it was in the shape of a panda bear.
I'm not so sure people caught on to the obvious.... Satellites are not in "Orbit".. "Space" is fiction.. the firmament is Impenetrable by Human means.   Maybe one day they will be shown, impossible to be told.

They knew it was from China bc everything in America is made in China.
Too funny

balloon spies from china try to steal your mind’s elation… https://t.co/UUpN9CPnLH
China gave us a spy balloon.  China gave us a pandemic.  China corrupts our youth via TikTok.  China steals our intellectual property.    It’s time to decouple from China completely.  Restore our supply chains and cut ourselves off our drug addiction for cheap Chinese products.
Exactly. Most of the rot leads back to the CCP.
America gave us, the patriot act, the obesity and opioid epidemic, it corrupts out youth via Facebook/Instagram, and bankers offshore our productive value via tax havens.   It’s time to decouple ourselves from neoliberals completely. Restore our democracy and self respect.
… and repudiate all debt to China to offset Covid obstruction as well as this newest provocation. Best idea Trump ever had!!!
Amen! This would be part of Trump's SOU if he were up there tonight.
Addiction to cheap Chinese drugs while we’re at it.
I think we should give them something in return
Don't forget about the fentanyl epidemic
Impossible because most of our government is corrupt working for china. Dems and republicans
Personally I think we all need to make a change to unite everyone.  Whenever yo might say the following, just replace it with "china's fault": Racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, ageist, ableist, because of liberals/conservatives.     It works in every situation.
And, fentanyl . . .
I think USA gave the world a pandemic, but I don't want to split hairs.
Chinese JUNK!!
Don’t forget fentanyl
Add fentanyl.
It takes a political will along with people's cooperation. You need a leadership which drives this. Unfortunately today it's not  the case.
You forgot they’re buying lots of farmland all over the US. Especially ones by military bases.
I understand greedy corporations wanting huge profits from cheap labor,our own government gave them incentives to move their factories. WTH But why did Americans buy the stuff. We had stuff made out of metal and wood and appliances that lasted 20 years. Ended up with junk plastic
But that where all the money come from , sorry "the big guy "
can you help?
Yeah best of luck with anything you just said
Better make sure we figure out how to make Vitamin C and key ingredients for antibiotics and other important drugs before we decouple from the wolves in sheep clothing.
It seems like it would be the best thing for the planet, too--if culturally we went back to buying quality and taking care of it, rather than disposable nicknacks.
Not my addiction to purchase cheap CHYNNA junk products. The banksters force it onto us. Can’t even buy American made because the greed to buy cheap products that don’t work. I buy American or go without. Sounds like it’s a problem for the entire American culture.
Realpolitick demands a total brek from China, &amp; a rapprochement w Russia to encircle China, destroy BRICS, save Brazil &amp; Argentina (Monroe Doctrine), destroy wokeness, &amp; a rapprochement w India, Saudi, Israel, &amp; new treaties w traditional Euro &amp; Pacific allies for same goals.
Explain how you direct a balloon horizontally.  Justifie que les États-Unia ont “donné” la grippe espagnole. Les jeunes américains ne sont pas corrompus parce que Américains? La propriété intellectuelle “volée” est-elle strictement américaine? Commentaires d’inculte…
If we could only boycott both Walmart and Amazon bc 90% of their merch is Chinese junk.  There are almost no other places to buy from.
This came to mind.
America gave us, the patriot act, the obesity and opioid epidemic, it corrupts out youth via Facebook/Instagram, and bankers offshore our productive value via tax havens.   It’s time to decouple ourselves from neoliberals completely. Restore our democracy and self respect.
Every disease in the last 145 years was weaponized at the Pirbright Institute a Rothschilds Institute.
Amen to that
Trump was right. Trump is right. Trump POTUS47
This!!!
People are crying about prices now. What do you think happens to prices if we do that?
Biden won’t say one bad thing about china tomorrow
The US government needs to incentivize businesses more and make it easier for companies to make  products that we get so cheap from China.
There’s a lot of cleaning up to do. From educational institutions, state governments, corporations and entertainment.  #InfiltrationFromWithin
Half of China is dirt-floor poor. That’s double the population of the US, sleeping with their cows. They have no idea what’s happening outside their straw hut village. They other half that live in cities are fed a steady diet of CCP propaganda
Then you should throw out all the Chinese-made products in your home now, and finally you can watch your inflation rise directly to the sky, 傻逼！
China gave us Hunter and Joe Biden!!!!
China floods our country with fentanyl.
Those four things listed are 100% accurate, but China did not force them upon the American people. Our politicians have allowed it to happen since the 1990’s. We’re all still waiting.
Tik Tok is awesome
Don't forget Fentanyl. Never forget!  Those commies killed George Floyd.

lol u got a plan? last time i checked after all the shouting us trade deficit to china increased!
Although they didn’t give us a pandemic… Fauci funded that shit.
They have taken over our government, you don't decouple with conquerors
who will buy your treasuries
Lol our youth is corrupted by a lot more than Tiktok. US biz have willingly given away intellectual property in their pursuit for cheap labor.  We cant decouple from China until new supply chains are created. Trump stole billions from US firms from tariffs but no supply chain inv
To jail….#terreHAUTE #EXECUTE
Fuck China in the neck with a sharpened dildo
I've been ringing the alarm on China's aggression long before they flew a spy balloon over Montana.  Spying on Montanans is a grave threat, and so is buying up our farmland. We've got to pass my bipartisan bill to block adversaries like China from acquiring American farmland. https://t.co/gAFP0ibO9A
Absolutely!! You are right on the mark and the money.
You’re one of the smart ones.
Also disturbing that some dry climate Middle East countries are buying water rights and crop land in the U.S. to grow alfalfa etc to ship back to their home countries to feed their livestock.
Did you sound the alarm when they did it during the last administration or did it just become an important issue recently?
How about stopping big AG from decorating water supplies to grow alfalfa to ship abroad for cattle feed???
Am I correct the Saudis are also buying lots of western land, especially with water rights, to turn us into their sharecroppers and feed them first?
"Spying on Montanans". Do you hear yourself?
The same should go for international corporations buying up farmland—keep it American and keep it local
They are also manufacturing 70 percent of products sold and used in the USA, what is your plan for this
You're a democrat?   Since when?
This is pathetic. For 40 years, all we've heard about Chna is "free trade". Donald Trump decides to make China a threat for whatever personal reasons &amp; suddenly the entire country has to hop on board.
Two things- I agree with you regarding China.  Highly disagree with delisting Grizzlies. If you’re afraid of them, stay in your house.
They prefer to let you own the farmland and vote how they tell you to.
Who pass the bill for China to be buying up land in Montana
It’s about damn time you address an issue with Montanans in mind and not your own selfish political agenda.
Cartels are active. What will you do?
Need a bill to stop rich friends of republicans from buying up public land that hikers, fishermen and hunters use.
They are also sending money to their families over her to buy houses so they can hide the money from their government, thus, driving up home prices.
Now do Saudi Arabia who by the way owns trump/kushner
so much for the free market lol
And please also include prohibiting corporations from buying residential homes.
Thank you for protecting our home senator
You should run for president
AND water rights.
Get it over the finish line ASAP
I agree, along with big corporations with the help of some of your closest colleagues in your state, holding a monopoly on product.
Do the same with Saudi Arabia.
Thank you for your practical approach to a legitimate long term challenge.  I look forward to having you as a Senator (even though we disagree on many things) after we relocate to Kalispell.
Enough talk. Actually do something.
Help Ukraine put an end to Russian terror! We appreciate all of your help, but we need you to be more active in the fight against terrorism. F-16 Fighting Falcons are required. It is within your state's power to stop Russia right now. 
You have done nothing Tester! Why did a civilian call out the balloon? Your useless and a liar!
You’re a CHINA lover! Grow some balls Tester…let China buy land in Montana!!!!! Allow Large Corp/tech companies buy up our Montana homes!!!!! Where are we to live?
And just like that… poof… you’re a republican for the next election then you can go back to being a lockstep Democrat the rest of the time… phony…
Yes! Why are we so stupid? Selling our forests to China, 2. Hell, American Corps built China by giving them jobs therefore an economy!  The Saudis have bought farmland in AZ &amp; deplete Phnx water to grow alfalfa. Kick them out!
He also will not support Veterans with problems with the VA, he keeps covering up for the VA an will NOT investigate the deep rooted cooperation there!!!
Maybe is compromised by China and thats why he is weak on them? Maybe the 61 MILLION they invested at UPenn where his PennBiden center is has something to do with it? Hmmmmmmmm
What about investing in our universities? What about Tiktok?
Then why do you support the current idiot-in-chief?
Russia is using numerous Republican Party members as agents of influence.
Why did Biden lie and then got the DoD to lie about spy balloons during Trump? WTF
Mr. President, we have been told that our military observed the Chinese Spy Balloon well before it entered our airspace. Who specifically made the decision not to bring it down once it violated our nations airspace?
It’s not that simple. Without a transition plan, shutting down large food processing plants just because of some foreign ownership would make food prices skyrocket and hurt the poor.   As usual GOP is using fear mongering and fake issues.
The GOP wants to RAISE AMERICAN FOOD PRICES.   Without transition plan, shutting down the existing huge food processing plants just because of some current foreign ownership would disrupt food supply, make food prices skyrocket.
Republicans cant stay away from cameras screaming and hollering about the Balloon from China, of course criticizing Biden for ...whatever.   But as it turns out, 3 of them flew over during Trump's administration.  Gee I wonder why there wasn't even a report about those??
These satellites can be tasked to look at specific areas of interest. Balloons can only go where the wind takes them, if they even make it to the US. Just ask the Japanese who used that technology to bomb the mainland US. Only 6 people died after finding an unexploded bomb in OR.
Have a look at them sometime on Google Maps and examine what's been removed.  Military bases -- particularly air force bases -- are redacted.
Additionally, this represents something very simple: the US has lost control of its own airspace.  See the U2 spy plane shot down over the USSR for reference.
Oh, one other minor detail: your assumption that I'm a Republican is inaccurate.
Because it didn't happen.
There are so many versions of this god damn balloon story and who knew what and when. And you know what? I bet none of them represent the truth as to what really happened. #spyballoon
Wrong
So now we can be mad at both of them for being failures.
Maybe because it never happened?
cuz u have 2 choices either it didn't happen or treason was committed.   Pick one.
How do we know they flew over during Trump's time?
Show me all your proof.. if you can
This has aged poorly. You may want to Google why Trump was in the dark about those balloons amd then probably delete this tweet
That 3 balloon story has been proved false.
Trump thought the Balloons sent by China were there to take photos of him and his all star criminal family and staff.
You know, there’s a picture of Trump looking up at the eclipse that would make a great meme.
I'd bet China has Herr Drumpf on record agreeing to allow them.
And they think China need a balloon to spy on us. Lol
It apparently went past Hawaii and Florida. Not over the continental united states. Big difference.
Obviously that's a line of bullshit obstructionism OR just flat out bullshit between the Pentagon establishment and the (former) elected President.
There was no report because they didn't exist. Three DOJ sources have already debunked your lie Tuvok.
Maybe because there were no balloons from China flying over during the Trump administration. Your Leftist Masters lied to you.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say  You probably still think Trump colluded with Russia
You’ve got More hot air than that stupid weather balloon.
LIE!! The Number one excuse BUUUUUT TRUMP  F/0
Total BS. Lies and your propagating them
It's been happening since 1992, this was just the first one since Nov 2020 when the Tangerine Mussolini pulled the US out of the open skies treaty like petulant children do.
A lot of trump cultists in here deep throating the fuck out of his boot over him letting 3 balloons fly over America without a word, yet are pissed at Biden's administration doing something about this one?
Because that report that it happened under Trump’s admin is obviously 100% false.  And because Joe made America look amazingly weak to China by allowing it to do what it did over our country for a week.  It’s actually quite simple to most reasonable people.
Where's the proof. Demonratz would've leaked like Niagara Falls to hurt President Trump. Didn't happen.
Wrong again Timmy! Keep snorting the coke
This is what’s fucked y-with the American media…THEY BLATANTLY LIED
May want to do some more reading.
Exactly, sir!  Also, if our enemies knew that we would be stupid enough to automatically shoot down balloons over populated areas, they would fill them BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGENTS - and let us take ourselves out.
Military leaders say that is not true. Another lie from this bumbling bafoon to Cover his posterior. He sounds like a 5 yr old “ But he did t too”
So far 0 evidence has been provided to prove the 3 balloons flew over during Trump's time in office. Unless you happen to have that proof....
Actually the Department of Defense said none flew over during Trumps Presidency....
Looks like none of you can keep your mouth shut about it.   "Don't worry about laws being passed,  or murders,  or giving all our money to Israel,  gentiles, there's a damned balloon! That's the most important thing! "
She's an absolute liar The info from the balloon sent all the info to China immediately &amp; they don't GAF if we know or not They have what they need &amp; is laughing at us. The balloon should have been shot down before it entered American air space Does China have something on Biden https://t.co/X88pV3T7po

She's got to be the worst press secretary ever I literally cannot watch her I will break my TV she and the pedophile in the White House both raise my blood pressure higher than it should ever be

I won't waste my time listening to any of them any more. They all lie then try to turn it around on conservatives.
You sincerely believe that the US military doesn’t have the basic capability to interfere with intel collection of a balloon? 
I do NOT like her but she’s doing her job
Of course they do
This balloon is a distraction . China did not send a friggin balloon across the US while the greatest military in the world watched  come on people this is some deep state bullshit !!
MAGA are so unaware of what's going on around them, they didn't know about the spy balloons under Trump.

So what day are we releasing all our weather spy balloons over China? And which country should we launch them from? Assuming it will fly east like the China balloon did. Turkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Pakistan? Pick one. Bet it wouldn't make it across China's border. Not even close. https://t.co/HaGG8ye61d
We should send them something that is guaranteed to be there in 30 minutes or their next one is free………and I am not talking about a pizza.
Londonistan?.. X.
The founding fathers of this country made a mistake I believe by not making us a conquering nation. Right after WW2 we had the nukes and could have taken over the world. No more war, we own everything everyone is free. Now it’s going to be WW3 with a nuclear glow.
DoD knew about it but DNI was clueless.  Typical.
No need… we have satellites in orbit. Idk why don y’all get your head out your asses, they also have satellites, in orbit…

You’re right, Nancy. I wish they could have blocked, but don’t think that happened.
GM Sis  you seem to have disappeared from my timeline  just wanted to say Hi 
Agreed
Come on man!
Really ? The Pentagon has confirmed that at least three Chinese spy ballons flew over the US during trump's presidency.
If they hacked it they could have navigated it to someplace it could safely be examined
#LiesLiberalsBelieve unfortunately.
You mean the failure of the county having the lowest unemployment in 60 years?

Ahhhh so many failures,greatest POS lying treasonous president ever
What's going to piss me off is the fake exaggerated roars of approval and incessant clapping for his inane white-washed generic statements. It'll be boring and infuriating at the same time!
How could we block it exactly?!   Biden allowed it to travel across our entire nation!       - DO YOUR JOB AND IMPEACH BIDEN!   This isn’t a game.  China is not playing.    I HATE how weak we are perceived with Biden.   Bad things coming.
Yeah right? They could have shot the thing down when they first found out about it. Incompetent assholes.
Several Chinese balloons were over the United States during the Trump Administration under Republicans! This traitorous secret need’s investigation #Balloon #balloongate #ChineseSpyBalloon #Chinese #Republicans #GOP #BREAKING #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes

I don't know. That side-arm throwing has got the speed, but does it have the distance?
I wish I had $5 for every MAGAt bullet fired at that balloon in the last week.
I am waiting for the particulars of prior Chinese balloon incursions during the Trump administration as alleged by anonymous Biden administration officials. In the meantime, Biden let his family business partner attack America for days with NO response.
With anonymous being the operative word.
As Glenn Beck says, it was a  “shark bump” and we definitively proved we’re ready to be eaten!
Yet another Trump superpower. He stopped the entire population of the USA from looking at the sky for weeks at a atime.
As they’ve admitted in the past - their sources are one another.
It's hearsay misinformation don't let them fool you,  they're only trying to deflect their ineptness and failure.
the sources of fake articles are always anonymous lol
You get the same answer from the left when we ask for pictures showing them celebrating juneteenth from yrs back. They don't exist
There was zero bludgeoning of trump in media over a balloon...  Thats 100% irrefutable evidence that it didnt happen. Lol
Lol all you do is lie for attention..so I guess it works
Somebody "attacked America." Calm down, Mary. 
I’m sure relevant information will come to light… or maybe it will be kept quiet for strategic reasons. I’m betting the military had radar and communication jamming equipment doing their thing before we even heard of it.   They also might want to let it land in the water.
 our WOKE MILITARY is on 
They’ll say it’s classified bullcrap. Good luck with that.
Kind of like the Pelosi tapes, It takes a couple weeks to manufacture the evidence.
You should really focus on staying below the radar now that your coup memo... BEFORE THE ELECTION... is being taken up by the grand jury. Lawyer up dude!
Poor bumpkin, Trump had a bank account in China.  Vanky got trademarks from there.  We have to get more direct with your Judicial Watch types at the local level.
Anonymous...they talk "transparency" out the wazzu
Attack? 
Well, if you’re looking for trump business partners, you wouldn’t be looking primarily for the Chinese — unless you meant Ivanka — but for Russian balloons.
Have you talked with Ivanka? She likely has the info you may be seeking Tom.

Wow, I am surprised you have to tweet between your many grand jury appearances where you spend an hour taking the 5th… (or did you already plea out?)….
I hope Trump makes a statement.  Since Trump must weigh in on everything his lack of a statement tells me its true.
WAIT ON-THEY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE TO THIS SPYING FREE FOR ALL BY BIDEN, I'M SURE.
We’re waiting for the particulars of your deposition. In layman’s terms. Because… you’re a layman.
Um remember when trump had a hidden bank account in China  Or when his daughter got trademarks on ventilators &amp; her knock-off clothing  etc  No?  Because you don't appear to believe in something called facts.
I’m sure The DOD will get back to you.
Please. If it happened during Trump, just as with everything else, it would’ve been 24 / 7 news.
Does that degree in English makes you a military expert?  --&gt; It appears as though you have zero military expertise.  --&gt; You have never served in an Administration  --&gt; You talk a lot.
Anonymous sources is just propaganda.  We already have someone of record from the previous administration that refuted it.
that was not a Chinese balloon. That balloon was launched from Fairchild AFB in Washington State. It was used to spy on Montana militia groups.
Do you get lonely in that head of yours.
They were gonna take the big guys 10 percent away if he shot balloon down too soon
What did the balloon attack
trump could say it himself and you would still spin it. Sad
Hey Tom, GFY!
Exactly, prove it happened.
Same 50 Intel who said Hunter's Lap Top was Russian Misinfo
Yeah…And the JFK stuff.
pentagon = “anonymous Biden Administration officials”.   Clown.
Can tell us anything about your Grand Jury testimony?
Did Jake Sullivan implied?
Me too.  Let's hear them.
I’m waiting for you to say something intelligent. I guess I’m in for a loooong wait.
I guess it's time for the balloons to 'drop'...
“Anonymous Biden Administration officials” otherwise known as the Department of Defense. Tom, you’re annoying
16o) If you’re upset about a Chinese spy balloon 60K ft in the air, wait until I tell you about the time a sitting U.S. president &amp; a whole bunch of Republicans tried to overturn an election and overthrow our govt with a deadly insurrection right here on the ground.
Look up legal data being sent and investigated in Sweden. SGT reports
It matters not what others have done or not done. What he did was wrong and indicates weakness and a President not becoming of his Position of President of the USA And the Oath he took. He Promised US under Oath did he not?  But we're the Maga Radicals?   Evil is Amongst Us All.
If Trump raped a nun on the street in broad daylight and you saw it with your very own eyes. You without the tiniest question would refuse to denounce his behavior. How seriously should anyone take what you have to say?
All lies
Exactly
That claim came from the Pentagon.   Are you accusing military officials of lying?
meanwhile billions still being stolen in Ukraine.
Tom,  there's a Trump balloon dossier.
How about the forensic findings on this downed balloon?
We don’t care
By anonymous, you mean the Pentagon. It’s the Pentagon, they don’t owe you (who are you?) a damn thing.
That's right business partner!
This is the first time they have accused Trump of doing something after they got caught doing it, rather than before like they usually do.
Ha, you are hilarious. It is Waldo's and Ivanka's business partner. You know MAGA trinkets and trash and Ivanka's patents...lol. Such performative tweets you make. And I thought it was the Pentagon that made the statement about the last Admin.
Let's see irrefutable evidence not the Adam Schiff kind.
Owning the radical right with a weather balloon.  Priceless.    Let's go Brandon.
Yet you still skip leg day Tom.
If it’s true, they Should Court, Marshall Miley
Never, INSIDE the USA, drifting through the middle of our country, for a WEEK!
The fact that t-rump hid details while Biden admitted the ballon was there &amp; took it out tells you everything you need to know about both you &amp; t-rump administration
I am waiting, too !
Maybe they meant birthday balloons.
High TREASON
Ivanka Donald had business in China Mar a Lago had Chinese
“We know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying.” – from Solzhenitsyn —- using balloons  is a dirty trick
China Joe
And still…..nothing will be done!
Commie Trump allowed it and invited more flights from China!
If it had happened they’d have wasted more money on another unfounded impeachment,
Who cares
Yeah we’re also waiting for indictments &amp; convictions for all insurrectionists- my money says you’re singing like a jaybird to Jack while continuing to incriminate yourself here. Classy guy…
Ridiculous. Seek professional help.
“Attack?” When did conservatives get so freaking soft.
Try these anonymous Biden administration officials at the Pentagon.
a weather balloon is not an attack, stop being so alarmist
Previously undiscovered Balloon incursions during Trump admin!!!  If they were undiscovered, then why do we hear about it NOW!
Trying to lie your way out of your complicity of wrongly telling Trump those sensitive documents were his personal property?
Anonymous source" huh is that not guy that said he had proof of Russias involvement with Trump, shifty Shift...
There will be hearings and very likely to be exposed as a lie by the Biden admin.
Zero under Trump,
It’s another socialist democrat lie
they disabled the spy capabilities tom
Maybe the balloons were a promotional item from the Bank of China, thanking Trump for having an account with them…
We are supposed to believe that Trump blatantly screwed up something while President and the media didn’t cover it?
Hopefully your indicted with A-hole Trump for 1/6 also...for being a pretend lawyer and giving him such Great advice
It was legal under the Open Skies Treaty during Trump Admin. President Trump began procedures for withdrawal in 2019. In May 2021 Biden told Moscow it would not re-enter the pact. BUT, this is Lying Joe's administration. Did he or didn't he????  In 7 June 2021 Russia  withdrew.
Brandon is a liar?
I would like to see proof of Chinese balloons over the USA under Trump administration. Anonymous sources are tough to believe.
It’s not according to anonymous Biden sources .  Here’s a Forbes article .
If Miley knew and didn’t tell the POTUS Trump of an incursion of our air space.. Treason charges
Their aren't any particulars another lie fabricated by the Democratic party
#joesgottago
I swear the left cant be held accountable for nothing .. A Senator and VP STOLE classified docs and the are like Trump did. A SPY Balloon goes over America well Trump had 3 (not true) Demoncrats take responsibility! We will lose our country if you dont!
Hey Tommy boy, did you find a shirt that fits you? How’d your court date this week go?
So they finally shot it down! Well all the information they stole from are country was automatically sent back too china , what ever we recover of that balloon is already in china’s hands
Three Balloons Trump O Biden 1.
We love Trump and there were no balloons !!!!! TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
said the stuppist person on twitter with the dog view. $TSLA
Attack?   Lol.  Is that what we are calling it?
Just published. Did nothing. So go ahead and complain. Hey guess what Biden took it down. Trump did nothing.
Tom, if you think they actually have it, they would have attacked President Trump then.  Another smoke screen,  " has all the earmarks of Democrats lies".
The idea of waiting should have crossed your mind before you started tweeting. You’re not one to say you F ed up like that non Atty advice you gave Trump re MAL. There you F ed up bigly.
Shouldn't you be preparing your sphincter for prison?
Right on.
Nobody has to tell you shit.  You don’t have any security clearance.
It's #treason - Biden is a CCP asset and what he did gave comfort &amp; aid to our enemy.
Attack?? Lol
Ivanka 24 Patents  Trump secret Bank acct. Beijing active  Meanwhile Biden Has been more forceful against China than any American POTUS ever .  Chips act Order 39k tech workers out of China (1day) Aerospace barred from selling parts  Committed to defend Taiwan  Balloon 
Never happened on Trump watch!!!
ATTACK? This was a harmless Chinese surveillance balloon and we were jamming its sensors from the Aleutians all the way to the shootdown off the Carolinas.   Don't let your fanciful imagination get as big as your biceps, Tommy Boy.  This wasn't Pearl Harbor II.
It just left wing BS
Great deduction TomUS Americans are too wanting the truth. Please Don't give up the Fight Tom evil Dems don't. Shut Dems up with Truths....
China owns the entire Biden crime family.
H Clinton----who actually gave Putin control of much of US uranium...even had her pet Robert  Mueller then FBI head run samples to PUTIN in Moscow for a secret Tarmac meeting.
I won’t believe it was a spy balloon until I see proof. And have zero faith in the pentagon suddenly coming up with BS that just so happens to deflect from Biden’s failures.   If John Radcliffe says there were no balloons during Trumps tenure, I’d believe him before anyone else.
If this was true, someone would have leaked this during the Trump campaign.
Marco Rubio (R), co-chairman of the Senate Intelligence  Com.  opened that door, Ask Him.
This is all "Clean up on aisle 46" people.  "IF" these balloons were over the USA during Trump even once, much less 3 times, they would have impeached him.  Keep in mind, the media went nuts over two scoops of ice cream for a solid week...
How'd your grand jury testimony go you fucking traitor
If they know about it, they also would have been officials in the Trump administration. Meanwhile, what's up with all Ivanka's fast-tracked China trademarks?
Family business partner?   Who had floors in Trump Tower? Who made $54mil from China whilst president? Who paid more taxes in China than US? How many trademarks did Ivanka get?   Fitton you lie, you POS
Totally irrelevant! Serves absolutely no purpose. The one and ONLY concern is the current security of our Country. This is NOT a Trump v Biden issue. It must be fully investigated. Quite possible that Trump and the military may have been at fault and should also be scrutinized.
Grow up already, you sound deranged.
Good God, did your mother drink Manhattans when she was pregnant and then drop you on your head post partum? It's the best and only explanation for your stupidity.
Took a week before they shot it down! Pathetic &amp; weak Joe! #SlowJoe
stop rationalizing the insanity of the left, Joe Biden is a puppet and now EVERYBODY knows it. We are being invaded in the Southern Border and now by the Chinese, he is destroying America via Deep State
“We know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying.” – from Solzhenitsyn
Anonymous is the CIA Stooge Squad. Everybody knows that by now.
President Biden handled the Chinese Spy Balloon flawlessly. The Pentagon was able to collect data from the balloon while simultaneously preventing the balloon from gathering US data. He ignored the Retrumplican idiot$ and the country is safer because of it.
Sell out. You sold out Trump.  Sub bitch
What was the court appearance about ?... You singing Tommie 
Oh...you mean like Trump sitting on his hands when Covid broke out forgetting that a ban on Chinese flights did not stop Chinese flying through Europe to the U.S.?
When will the officially label the largest thief in American history? #networthsweep
General Milley hid that Chinese spy balloons were flying over America from Trump.  General Milley testified that he told China he would warn them if the USA attacks.  General Milley just overruled Biden on shooting down Chinese spy balloon in Montana.  ARREST General Milley NOW! https://t.co/l9VDa3L3Hj
FLASHBACK: Never forget that General Mark Milley said he would give China a heads up if the U.S. ever launched an attack
Damn he is getting... Railed
You ALLEGEDLY think having sex with minors should be legal - well as long as they're 16.   ARRSET KILLER KEEMSTAR NOW!
He said 19 yr dating a 16yr isn’t weird
It’s very situational but you can’t go around saying that 
It is wild watching people who know practically nothing about the issue taking such strong positions.   People should be focused on inquiry right now, but maybe you should stick to what you’re used to - internet gossip
He’s tryin to stay relevant
Yep, arrest that scumbag for treason.
Rare W political take from Keem
Surprised that most military general haven't fought back at their oppressors yet
Don't you have a date with a high schooler tonight?
I see you suddenly don't love all that "friidum of spiich babyyy"!
And that's only IF it actually happened and this isn't all just news to cover Biden's failure.
General Miley probably rich
Treason is still punishable by death btw
He's just a military politician, but yes dude needs to go
Ummmm so this guy is the reason why those chinese spy balloons were crossing the continental USA with no interference/military intervention…ARREST THIS GUY NOW
Based Keem
It’s time for me to step in 
Let's pretend for a moment that this man knows 2,000% more about geopolitics than you and your right-leaning news sources. K?
source??
Gas chamber for Milley
I'll take care of it, Daniel.
Generals can never be trusted
General Miley cannot overrule Joe Biden, Biden is the commander-in-chief, he can only make recommendations that Biden chooses to, or not to, act on. People should be more responsible with their language especially when accusing someone of essentially treason.
#military needs to turn up on these corrupt traitors
Do you have a source for any of this? Or you just on that grift?
Trump appointed him
You need to understand and control your white rage keem
He's a traitor
Based take. He should be tried for treason &amp; done away with
Benedict Milley
Man needs arrested for treason smh
Lol dudes a spy
Yes arrest our highest ranking officer in the military! Pls never report on anything military/war related again u clown
Oooh keemstar started WW3
Isn't that like treason or some shit
China got hands dipped in USA cookie jar
lol for what? You think the Trump or Biden would know better how to handle this? and not a 4 star general?  Biden could have overruled Milley. Milley didnt overrule him..Biden listened to him and took his advice.  Trump wouldve started WWIII
Smh.. needs to be fired
Stop speaking about which you know nothing. The balloon was allowed to travel 1) to reduce risk on the ground because of its large payload, 2) intelligence assets (Combat Sent, Rivet Joint) analyzed its radar and communications for great gain.
Dang, this is actually pretty informative
What the…
Not as bad as general grevious
I thought you talked about influencer drama
Treason what a dirty man he is.
I'm having a feeling that no one wants to destroy America more than its own government and military
Chinese puppet this guy is. Probably on their payroll.
He has a whole lot of badges from a whole lot of fake wars
This fucker should be arrested for treason!! Wtf!!
Yeah hid  when no one else actually saw them .  Stop posting fake news you're just pushing the lie
Isn’t this the same mf who “predicted” we’d go to war with china in 2025?
And why would the U.S attack China for no apparent reason? Isn't this the warmongering attitude of America other countries talk about?
Stick to drama keem. You got shit Facebook meme level understanding of politics.
Fire that rat bastard!
General Mattis says he never of heard of this, and Milley is an untrustworthy source. I think it's more likely it didn't happen under Trump but Milley is trying to save Bidens face.
Let’s not be stupid…,WE all know Trump knew and got paid to ignore it!!Who else got paid???
Guys a complete scumbag
Trump should have fired this scumbag back in 2016.
Think we should have him killed hes one of them
Rules of treason  hanged or shot ?
How the fuck does he even have his job still. Throw him and his supporters to the curb
Dude, stop telling people to kill themselves. Have you not learned?
BIG Balloon for what? Do DOD old  &amp; Joe BiAss WH know? All should be fired, charged &amp; kicked out!!! These can be infrastructures/military signals collector/jammer, missiles probe, carrier groups locators/killer w/ electromagnetic pulse &amp; neutron bombs... playing easy = TREASON!
And they just now remembered, you gullible fool
Nothing was hidden. We already know that Trump refused to read his daily security briefing.  After taking office, Biden ordered stronger defenses against Chinese espionage. So Biden was able to detect spy balloons while Trump was not. This is also why Trump missed the balloons.
Shoot his hand in person and got Starbucks with him once dudes an Asshole
There were no spy balloons under trump. That’s another lie. Fuck you keem sense retard
KJP just said a TikTok was sent to the press from the National Security Council re the spy balloon.. they're spoon feeding China government info on an app China made 🤣
I THOUGHT I heard that right!!!
Me: Did that bit(h just say she sent a TikTok from the NSC?
I thought that too..wasn't it supposed to be banned and WTF are we doing sending out info on an app?
What?? Seriously? 
The DOD probably uses TikTok for all communications.
I heard that too. Til Tok?
In journalism, a tick-tock is a type of story that focuses on chronological order of events. A "tick-tock" was sent to the press, NOT on TikTok the app. Sheesh!
Look a Chinese spy balloon! I’ll give you the details over TikTok 
Make it make sense SMFH
That's what I heard as well.
They're not. She said "tick-tock". It's a journalistic term that means detailed chronology of events, or timeline.
While they are calling to ban this app. they are using it to communicate.
Can't fix stupid
Wait!!  She JUST said the administration is not allowed to use TikTok
Wow. I got nuthin.
They think we don't know?
Joe Biden thought the Chinese were just delivering a load of crack and cash to Hunter.
Their Idiocy is boundless. 
This administration is getting more stupid everyday
Call me crazy, but to me, a disgraced, twice impeached former President, who personally supervised the packing and shipping of highly classified, top secret documents to a golf club in Florida, is a far greater security threat to the U.S. than a balloon from China. #DeadlineWH
Not crazy.
So you still believe everything the Trump hating establishment tells you.
You obviously have no clue about the Biden families several billion dollar investments with the Chinese.  By Hunter's own admission his business partner and client was the "f*cking spy chief of China".  If the orange man had a similar setup he would be locked up without trial!
You are so right
Stolen from a poster on Tigernet!! Who really shot down the China balloon. https://t.co/xLu803TpPC
SNOOPY SCORES A KILL!!!!
My hero!! 
We are in the best of hands, at least not Milley
True 
Now that’s hilarious 
It's a Red Baron Spy Balloon!
Love it!
Without a doubt 
Waggoner go  snoopy
My hero! 
a surveillance balloon from China was the talk of the town last week, and we want to escalate the situation with our own balloon. Maybe decorative. Maybe a giant weather balloon that can drop a big water balloon? The pranks are https://t.co/io5lTkc3KA
I know this isn't about a spy balloon, but really there are much more serious threats from the CCP. How China Screws American Investors with Private Equity https://t.co/WtxV4a9Q1y #China https://t.co/W7RPHZFuea
investors are greedy and chose to gamble their $. After 30 years, they got enough return. Have to take on risks before can get reward buddy. 2008 was the swindle of the century
Hmm. Got me primed for "how China's screws are screwing America".
U.S. Military security zone around the balloon debris
Wish you guys would just upload your videos to Twitter instead of YouTube.
this is the real threat to the world.
This guy's fearmongering content is probably responsible for at least a couple hate crimes. The dark money must be pretty sweet.
Lots of US pension funds also have exposure to Chinese ShitCos via stakes in private equity/VC  funds with Chinese portfolios, I’m sure most Americans would be appalled to learn their nest eggs were invested into Chinese companies with faked financials &amp; shady business models
Ok falun gong facist cult.
Many got screwed because they are rapacious. 
"American investors":
Exclusive: Chinese balloon is part of a vast aerial surveillance program run by the People’s Liberation Army. The spy balloon effort operates in Hainan province off China’s south coast and has for years collected military intelligence, U.S. officials said. https://t.co/R2LsRLD9GH
But 50 retired intelligence officers have said that this is a Russian hoax!
what ??? is america butt hurt that china has a low cost surveillance system that makes american satellite  systems look excessively expensive ,
No it's not
If you guys had the Watergate story today the headline would just be "Nixon Officials Report Nothing Amiss" / ""Everything A-OK," adds Haldeman."
Alright, so how many spy satellites does the US have ?
Why Use balloon when they Have Actual Satellites seems like a lot of CRAP
source: i made it up lol
It's time to be afraid, everyone! Your government said so
Why didn’t the previous administration take action?
so much exegeration
"..former vast aerial surveillance program?" Now that the word is out, they will just be a world league of free practice targets wherever they drift! China wants balloon back! Once our security group lab is done with debris, why not? Barrels or dumpster container?
What could a balloon do that a satellite cannot?
And apparently the balloon got in through Alaska all the way across Canadá and got into the US through Idaho.   And it’s path is the same as an airplane so all the satellites we have couldn’t detect it. And it can only go 60mph.   Oookkkkkk
Might as well let FIFA run this country. And get salt bae to be president. At least he gets to be places a regular person isn’t allowed to.
Something like this went over my head once
No doubt.
I wonder if somebody will report there weather balloon is missing followed by an embarrassing silence.
So you’re saying the situation looks like THIS — only they’re balloons?
Weather balloon will not fly to the high altitude that don’t have weather, there is doubt it could have carried some political dissidents ?
I am shocked, just shocked! that a major nation tries to collect military intelligence on other nations. Good god folks we need to get a grip. This is expected, has been detected, and our military will adapt. It is arrogant to assume only we can conduct intel.
When I looked up at the balloon, I told myself, fuck, what a waste, all the advertising spots worth millions.
So…what.
And they're upset that the US don't like it. Seriously, China needs to be ignored and sanctioned. Greatest gaslighting abusive nation the world has ever seen.
Cow jump over the moo
Weak US President are selling US people data to Devil Communist Country, so disgusting
All your spying is belong to Orange Balloon  guy and his fellow traveler Xi
It is really a kind of art to write an article with so much garbage and propaganda. Is there also solid evidence or just more phrases?
You have it all wrong.... China was simply helping #Biden find additional classified documents he's left all throughout America... They have altruistic motives. #ChinaSpyBalloon
Shoot them down good training exersise
Y’all will say anything to get us to go to war.
Most of the tweets under this topic were written by Chinese people who defend their CCP.
So they government spy on us on the daily basis and why they don’t show the apparent device.  Why is it we gotta take their word for it.  Iraq all over.  We still waiting to locate the WMD’s the Hussein had hidden in his kingdom.  BS news.
so what？it sounds like China is a prostitute while America is a virgin.  LoL..
They ran it right over Conus, because Biden is a joke

This is a lie.
Weak clueless idiot Biden
After the Chinese balloon was destroyed, Beijing refused to answer the call from the US Secretary of Defense. The Biden administration humiliated itself and danced with wolves.
Yeah it surveils the weather you fucking morons.
Shoot them all down.
With all the technology China has you want us to believe they were using a balloon anyone could see with their naked eye? LMAO GTFOH
I am beginning to think Biden needed to get permission from China to destroy the balloon 🎈!
You know he did he a puppet for the CCP
https://t.co/x4O7cFvRNt  Just in case you were wondering folks   Trump created a task force protecting us from the threat of China's spy balloons,  but Biden immediately shut it down, calling it racist... 👇👇👇
CORRECT! Trump would have answered the spy  balloon this way..
I'm down with that
DC Enquirer is dogshit.
I wouldn't say that
Nobody asked you.
It’s the difference of a true President verses a habitual liar fraud and thief!
Funny how trumps DOJ task force missed 3 Chinese spy balloons while Bidens administration detected, disabled and shot one down...
Yeah… I’m gonna need a source for your preposterous claim there bud.
Shocker
Socialists don't think .....
Disgusting
Now, these liars are claiming, baloons invaded during Trump Administration !
Why did he let 3 fly over and do nothing
Trump 2024
Shocking.
Beijing Biden is a genius!!
Where is Space Force and Airforce?  It's their mission to protect and defend us. Too busy worrying about pronouns?
Who.. ?
Still waiting for him to be impeached, arrested all of the above
Mr. Jeffries. It is time for you to take your stand, move us. Please move us, move us, gang structure of your backbone lined up with your structure under your mind with God, and start your movement no longer at the house Negro but become the Negro leader. Thank you.
F.J.B. !!
Lol that photo edit on Brandon is hilarious 
No surprise  there, BUY-DEN  canceled  ALL OF TRUMPS ORDERS HE COULD!!
Joe Biden
Wait wasn’t the balloon white
So which one is in china's payroll
He listens to everyone but the American people. Xi has control over Joey.
TDS everything he did must go!
Not wondering...have no doubt that he looked out for the best interest of American people
Same thing happened with Covid when he wanted to stop the planes coming in from China
So now we're protecting the rights of spies??
Are these the same spy balloons he says didn't exist?
Truth!
So be knew ?
Just in case you were wondering.
LMAO  no he didnt  
Let's go Brandon
Wonder why
After it went almost all the way through the US
I seriously don’t know how we let someone like Joe Biden into office.
When you don't have a real solution to the problem, you call it racist as Biden did, and everyone backs off like usual
Biden is all about greed.
Biden is the worst US president ever!
rematch can't want . trump going  chew him up and spit him out.
Biden and the democrats are racist against us all,  they only care about the power to control their deplorables and Walmart people with lies for their votes.  Can't trust liars.
I love how the left screamed that Trump was a dictator and deranged, that just about describes good old Joe!  We have a communist trader in the WhiteHouse and that’s just the nice part!!  Wait til you find out the ugly side!
Yea ok and what profit did Trump get
Trump is a racist helloooooooo anybody home,
I'm sure China instructed Biden to shut it down
If you wondering, I’m still with Trump. I still trust and believe in my faith in God that he knows how to help us. As for Black people we are the independent party. We’ve been so many frightened, that we bagged up under the democratic party. Thanks for Mr. Obama, thank you!
Your correct. China is steeling technology from universities that are doing research for the government. They are steeling intellectual properties from US industry. Biden stopped the fbi from investigating and stopping this.
Alzheimer’s Joe IS a Chinese asset!!!
Ef  Joe Biden. He is a coward and a communist
This imposter is not the real Joe Biden
Trump stands for Americans, Biden is for Biden!
Joe Biden is the most racist President Ever!!
He because Biden is a Commie Traitor
Hold Biden accountable. Impeach sorry ass
Biden is a traitor an agent of China and should be arrested and put in prison for the rest of his life
Biden took all safety measures away that Trump had in place. Look where we're at now. In debt, left good ppl in Afghanistan, Record Inflation, Open Borders, the most Divided Country in History. The Biden's are looking more and more like Double Agents. He's on the side of money.
But there were Spy Balloons during Trump as well. So what exactly was this Task Force doing?
President Obama created a task force to protect America from a pandemic, and Trump shut it down. Big Mistake!
Pedo joe is a communist and needs to be charged tried and convicted for treason. Now we have spy balloons wow we have sunk to a new low in this country.
Biden is scared to death China will out him and his family for all their influence peddling...
BUY-DEN  &amp; most  in his administration  are paid for by China Communist Party, especially  Tony  Blinkin!!
What do you expect from. senile Joe
biden don't know a racist form a balloon.
Possibly impeach Biden “ the liar “ and remove him from running this country
We love President Trump!!!
WE MISS YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!MAGA
Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46
Everything about trump is racist.
Biden the  is lost.
President TRUMP was a true American hero!
China is getting what they paid for.  Joe's all in.  For China !!!!
Obiden better get his head out and start thinking about saving our country in the history books Obiden will be the worse president in our history
Bullshit.
A countries protection against foreign enemies is not racist. The person who invented the word racist was probably a racist
Because him and all the rest of his morons ARE TOTAL ASSHOLES !!!!!!!!
Biden is a twat
Want real news? Watch The Duran; Rubin Report; REDACTED; Joe Rogan; News Altlas; Rebel News; Clyde do something; JP Reacts; Dr. John Campbell; MOATS; Monket Werx... Then listen to MSM and see who is full of BS...
This goof shut down everything that was working, only because he doesn't like Trump. Oh, and he's an idiot.
Twitter has SUSPENDED the account of Montana Senator Steve Daines for using a HUNTING profile picture!  They claim it glorifies violence against the Animal Community. At least until Elon Musk gets involved: Someone needs to be fired.
He's a demented fool. China is our enemy.
Unbelievable stupidity
Im not sure if this is true, but if it is you can quote me……..’bwahahahahaha’
BIDENS IS AN ASSHOLE !!!
Joe is an idiot. Worst fake ass president ever.
The world now realise why the majority of decent fair minded Americans voted in record numbers for President Biden the most popular President in American history especially after his emphatic State of the Union address! Schadenfreude!
I am not sure if this is real news, might be fake?  But what isn't fake is that moron Biden unraveled all the policies that were MAGA starting with Keystone, and immigration.  If Trump's name was associated with sometimes brilliant policies Biden unraveled them. Why? He's a hack!
Moronic post
President Trump on Truth 20 minutes ago: "No Balloons from China flew over the United States, in any way, shape, or form, while I was President. If they did we would have shot them down, immediately!"
Only a Traitor would think this was funny! That's why there is a Cult behind her! This is not American! Trump had 3 balloons from China and didn't let you know. That's what you like! Undercover information you should know. Pure Asinine!
Only a traitor would think Biden has been doing a good job.
That doesn’t even make any sense whatsoever. Doesn’t make anyone a traitor. In fact, it’s usually the ones that call people traitors are in fact traitors. I would reevaluate your loyalties.
The Dems have been calling Trump a traitor for years. Along with all the other shit they are accusing the right. My Loyalty is to America. 
Your loyalty should be with America, not Trump, that fucker isn’t even the president anymore. Move on and vouch for someone that actually has true character and a moral compass. Come on man. You don’t have to support Biden, just don’t get suckered by Trump.
So, who has true character and a moral compass? They have to be strong enough to get rid of the swamp. In the government.
At the end of the day, we should be united in a better America, and we need a middle ground to do so. Democrats aren’t gonna win, and Republicans aren’t gonna win. Other wise it would have happened already. I don’t think Biden or Trump are the ones to get us there.
I don't know how we are getting out of this. Too much going on. Evil everywhere. I put my trust in God.  Hopefully he doesn't decide to wipe us all out with a flood again.  I'll need to trade in the jet skis for a big boat. 
The MAGA/GOP Nutcase BOTS are attacking when they get triggered! They hate the truth, so they think by tweeting I will believe anything they type. BS! I welcome them here so I can Mute and Block their asinine asses.
WHY ISN'T FOX NEWS LETTING TRUMP CALL IN AND GIVE HIS OPINION ON THE CHINA BALLOON. I THINK ITS ALL PAUL RYAN, ANOTHER RINO TRUMP HATER WHO IS NOW IN A POSTION OF POWER AT FOX! WE WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR REAL PRESIDENT!
Yep! RyN won’t let him! Just like during the 2016 campaign.
Turn off FAUX
Because he hides secret documents and tells nothing but lies. He is irrelevant
RIN0 ryan is on the faux news board!
fox WENT TO THE DARK SIDE LONG AGO  CAN'T DECIDE IF TUCKER,HANNITY, INGRAHAM,  ET AL ARE STAYING ON TRYING TO RIGHT THE PROBLEM  OR IF THEY'LL JUMP SHIP WHEN THEIR CONTRACTS ARE UP
Ryan is, and always will be a democrat loser, regardless of what letter he mistakenly puts after his name.  He’s useless
I’m not planning to watch Beijing Biden’s crappy State of Disunion tonight on Fox News and I pray that their ratings take a nosedive DOWN into the toilet! I don’t like Paul Ryan!
Has been in position at Fox for 4 or 5 years and nobody did anything
Why does anyone watch Fox?  Why does anyone actually pay to cable TV?  Save your $.
Paul Ryan is married to a wealthy Dem, should tell you everything about this Rino!
If an individual hadn't spotted China's balloon from a window and then took a picture of it, the American people would have never known. That should concern every American. You have to ask, what else is the Biden administration hiding from the American people?
Transparent as Mud
That's A Scary ASF Thought 
To that point...
What about the 3 trump hid from America?
Democrats act as if it was great they waited to get the technology from it ! Only all that could had been done long before it’s trip across our nuclear facilities !!!! And with LiDAR and ground penetration radar I’d say they have some great information ! If we didn’t block signal
Good call !!!!!!!
There were no identifying marks on it. They could have easily called it a weather balloon and 99.999% of the GP would have accepted it. That said, it being a Chinese balloon could have been the actual lie the way this administration loves to create false flag events.
We be all over they ass!!! 
Premiere Xiden Regime use lies, deceit, propaganda, and coercion to poison, maim, and kill Americans
Notice how quickly &amp; quietly the China spy balloon has disappeared from the MSM news stories.  It's like it never happened.   Biden put the U.S. in harm's way by allowing China to electronically spy on us, then lies about it, then blames Trump &amp; the event has vanished altogether
A US military intelligence report from last year on China’s use of high-altitude balloons, mentioned sightings in Hawaii and Florida during the Trump presidency..  The report is the first indication that the US military was aware of Chinese spy balloons during Trump's watch.
Quit lying 
1) either he didn't care because he was trying to get them to help him get reelected, or 2) they didn't trust him because he had been itching to use the nukes.
The BALLOON was in our airspace. That makes it ours.  Hearing differing stories. Pentagon said the balloon was blocked from getting information yet we were watching it to see what information China was learning. If we had them blocked how did we study what they were looking at? https://t.co/UTruuDQgih
So by that rationale if we fly a military drone over a sovereign country's airspace without their permission it becomes their property?
If it lands on their ground after they shoot it down, it becomes theirs. They don't give it back.
Yes and how have we retrieved important data, when they haven’t recovered it out of the ocean yet! We are being lied to over and over again
They are probing the wire. Chinese think / plan long term, not like us planning profits only for the next quarter. How many electrical substations did they gather info on, Military bases, comm towers, water supplies, the list goes on. Don’t let anyone downplay this event.
I wonder if Joe's speech will make him look heroic over the balloon pop ,    Or will the speech run Trump down cuz he had balloons too ,  Or bothe ,
Laughter so the Pentagon said that did they? I say they were caught and blamed China.
The TALKING HEADS on MSM can keep telling me that the balloon fiasco happened three times under PRESIDENT TRUMP all they want! I’ll just say you can’t fool all the people all the time!!!! The boy who cried wolf scenarios comes in to play eventually!!
Your continued HATRED For the man is APPALLING!  Keep deflecting and defending joey!!  Your outright hypocrisy continues to show exactly who you are!!!!!
😂 No wonder Americans overblown about the stupid weather balloon from China. Do you think you can explain to this person how the phone works? #us politicians 🤣 https://t.co/Xn1W6D6udE
The U.S. with over 8xx billion dollars “defense” budget and pretty soon it will be a trillion dollars 
I won't even try! 
My answer would have been, "Perhaps you should ask Apple, who are not us!"
American politicians should already know by now that most of the US businesses do not and will not give a straight answer. It's always a maybe, depending on further details.
The answer is 'no' because that is iPhone, meanwhile only Android phone can be tracked by Google. Both those politicans didn't know what they were talking about.
What is now to stop China from sending a balloon over with a bio weapon? Now that they found out Biden will let one fly over the whole country.
Yes, one wonders.
I read on Business Insider that it was one of our own.  Who knows?
It definitely looked like a cheap thing. It is hard to believe it floated half way around the world.
How about an EMP? It would take out all electronics in all of North America.
They have not stolen the technology to do it yet.
PRC already released a devastating bio weapon. Balloons may have been one of the sources already.
Or an EMP that would set us back to the 1880s with no electricity, no cars, no computers, no fuel pumps, no lights, no heat…think about it. After a few weeeks when half of the pop. kills the other. China could waltz in and take what they wanted
Or ANY country? What's to stop them? Absolutely NOTHING...
Did you see the balloon from China in the sky making the recent news!? …and did you see the words on the balloon? Here is my parody painting of the Chinese balloon!   #mattstarrfineart #artists #China #Chinese #balloon #chinesefood #fooddelivery #deliverfood #weatherballoon #art https://t.co/hbQTAbUolr
bring the food or just turn around, Chinese spy balloon
How weak America must have seemed to China under trump! Three spy balloons flew in from China while trump was in office! He did nothing! Thank God for President Biden! 🇺🇸
I bet he thinks it now looks like he struck out 3 times  And President Biden hit it out of the park on 1st pitch.
Really? Are you kidding me?
No balloons from China flew over the United States in any way, shape, or form while I was President. If they did we would have shot them down, immediately! -DJT  2/7/23
Wow, your Lord and Savior, the Traitor-in-Chief, denies it, so it HAS to be true!  #MAGACult
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THE BALLOON WASN’T FROM CHINA? YEAH… JUST REMEMBER THAT!
"On Monday, Deputy SoS Wendy Sherman led a briefing on China’s balloon espionage for some 150 people from about 40 embassies... The department has also sent to every U.S. Embassy 'detailed information' on the espionage that can be shared with allies and partners."
"Between our disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, the China balloon fiasco and emptying the terrorists from GITMO, Biden and company display weakness, betrayal and lack of resolve on the world stage" -- Lt. Col. Brian Sullivan, former FAA Special Agent
We now know spy balloons from China never flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Biden apologize tonite for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did not happen under Trump?
Of course not!!!
Sadly, I think you're right. And that is why the China spy balloon flight which Biden allowed to proceed for 7 days must be commented on every day and never allowed to "disappear" like the story of Jared Dowell disappeared "BAM" ... just like that
When will trump apologize for this?
I having hallucinations thinking he would admit and give Trump a shred of credit ??
No if he mentions it at all he will double down on the lie.
There were 3 brief incursions, but they didn’t come close to flying over the country coast to coast. That balloon didn’t pick up anything the Chinese satellites and spies haven’t already mapped out. It was a diversion and a bully probing to see what they could get away with!
You've got some extra words in that tweet there, friend.   "We now know spy balloons from China flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Trump apologize for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did happen?"  Fixed it for ya.
He also said inflation was happening under Trump.
That's a lie, boy. Sit down.
After tens of thousands of acres of Missouri farmland have already been gobbled up by Chinese oligarchs, does Josh Hawley really expect Missourians to believe a balloon was his tipping point on banning China from owning our farmland?  In an election cycle? https://t.co/L9jBcpXt3t

China spy balloon in US  I don't want to set the world on fire I just want to breach your Domain Awareness Gap And with your admission, I know you can’t see me In my heart I have but one desire To drop an EMP on you, no other will do
Little wonder why I enjoy twitter so much when the news is rarely good.  It's ----- you silly people  that bring me back every day. 
If we didn’t add humor , we’d be crying, because you’re correct: the News is rarely good.
Exclusive: Chinese balloon is part of a vast aerial surveillance program run by the People’s Liberation Army. The spy balloon effort operates in Hainan province off China’s south coast and has for years collected military intelligence, U.S. officials said. https://t.co/R2LsRLD9GH
I am beginning to think Biden needed to get permission from China to destroy the balloon 🎈!
https://t.co/x4O7cFvRNt  Just in case you were wondering folks   Trump created a task force protecting us from the threat of China's spy balloons,  but Biden immediately shut it down, calling it racist... 👇👇👇
CORRECT! Trump would have answered the spy  balloon this way..
I'm down with that
DC Enquirer is dogshit.
I wouldn't say that
Nobody asked you.
It’s the difference of a true President verses a habitual liar fraud and thief!
Funny how trumps DOJ task force missed 3 Chinese spy balloons while Bidens administration detected, disabled and shot one down...
Shocker
Socialists don't think .....
President Trump on Truth 20 minutes ago: "No Balloons from China flew over the United States, in any way, shape, or form, while I was President. If they did we would have shot them down, immediately!"

I believe him 
that's nothing to brag about
Trump was well-known as an outrageous liar decades before he went into politics. He has always lied to meet his needs at the moment.
*The Pentagon has entered the chat*
So, for the past week, it was "THREE SPY BALLOONS FLEW OVER THE US AND TRUMP DID NOTHING!!" Now it's been dumbed down to this? A balloon from China... "drifted PAST Hawaii and across Florida” in 2019 as it rounded the world at about 65,000 feet, according to CNN. So, which is it? https://t.co/560vfFMMwx

I bet they tell us after looking at the equipment, that is was a weather balloon after all. Lying SOBs
There was a lot of repeating the same old lies about the supposed 3 Trump ones. Has it died down? This morning it was ridiculous. Maybe they're quieting down for State of the Union tonight.
Yeah..but they quietly let some guy outta gitmo
He sold our country to China. It was probably a ReMax balloon..checking out where they can station their army.
Was just chatting with my brother about all this. We see that when China decides to pull the trigger on us, the battle will then be full on, but not a second before God allows. Man has not quite filled the earth with sin yet, not quite.
Only a Democrat can get away with being senile, hiding in his basement, falling on stairs, falling off bikes, telling lies about his son and getting arrested, 9% Inflation, $5 gas, calling out for a dead woman, let China spy on us..and expect media to still be your cheerleader.
Yea and during that time that it was fresh in our minds they tried to make people believe that during our President Trump time in WH there were 3 balloons flying around what a crock of shit DemoKKKrats believe we are feeble minded like their supporters and believe n e thing said

It is not weakness. It is collusion. He is a traitor in every sense of the word. So are scores of people in the government. It's not bad one man band.
No one knows about the terrorist that was sent to live in vacation land Belize.
this isnt weakness-this is intentional- its on purpose-and on their point follows BBB agenda of the WEF- ask yourself what is the why-dig deeper

Hawley is too little too late: Many acres of Missouri farmland already owned by Chinese. Probably did not find out until Lucas Kunce informed him today.
No, but it's the point where he can be much more assured of popular support for the idea. That's politics.
At first, the chanted let's stop Bill Gates the American from buying farmland.
hmmmm...what color are these states that are selling their land to the Chinese?  Red perhaps?
I'd bet that if someone did the research, that if there was any pending legislation in the past to prevent foreign countries from purchasing US land it would have been the Republicans that stood against it.
He panders to the lowest of us, pretending he is the best of us. It's all a charade. Hawley is owned by foreign interests. He doesn't give a damn about America
I don't believe a damned thing any Republican has to say about anything and I 'm sure not interested in any ridiculous lies or false claims to patriotism from Jogging Josh, Q-Anon's January 6th Yellow Sprinter from MO.
He is a fraud and an insurrectionist
Could it be a Republican has recognized a real problem and actually wants to fix it?
The last time a MAGA tried to protect American farmers the rest of us had to bail them out. Unfortunately the conglomerate farms stole the bailout money from the small farmers.

But 50 retired intelligence officers have said that this is a Russian hoax!
what ??? is america butt hurt that china has a low cost surveillance system that makes american satellite  systems look excessively expensive ,
No it's not
If you guys had the Watergate story today the headline would just be "Nixon Officials Report Nothing Amiss" / ""Everything A-OK," adds Haldeman."
Alright, so how many spy satellites does the US have ?
Why Use balloon when they Have Actual Satellites seems like a lot of CRAP
source: i made it up lol
It's time to be afraid, everyone! Your government said so
Why didn’t the previous administration take action?
so much exegeration
"..former vast aerial surveillance program?" Now that the word is out, they will just be a world league of free practice targets wherever they drift! China wants balloon back! Once our security group lab is done with debris, why not? Barrels or dumpster container?
What could a balloon do that a satellite cannot?
And apparently the balloon got in through Alaska all the way across Canadá and got into the US through Idaho.   And it’s path is the same as an airplane so all the satellites we have couldn’t detect it. And it can only go 60mph.   Oookkkkkk
Might as well let FIFA run this country. And get salt bae to be president. At least he gets to be places a regular person isn’t allowed to.
Something like this went over my head once
No doubt.
I wonder if somebody will report there weather balloon is missing followed by an embarrassing silence.
So you’re saying the situation looks like THIS — only they’re balloons?
Weather balloon will not fly to the high altitude that don’t have weather, there is doubt it could have carried some political dissidents ?
I am shocked, just shocked! that a major nation tries to collect military intelligence on other nations. Good god folks we need to get a grip. This is expected, has been detected, and our military will adapt. It is arrogant to assume only we can conduct intel.
When I looked up at the balloon, I told myself, fuck, what a waste, all the advertising spots worth millions.
So…what.
And they're upset that the US don't like it. Seriously, China needs to be ignored and sanctioned. Greatest gaslighting abusive nation the world has ever seen.
Cow jump over the moo
Weak US President are selling US people data to Devil Communist Country, so disgusting
All your spying is belong to Orange Balloon  guy and his fellow traveler Xi
It is really a kind of art to write an article with so much garbage and propaganda. Is there also solid evidence or just more phrases?

Y’all will say anything to get us to go to war.
Most of the tweets under this topic were written by Chinese people who defend their CCP.

After the Chinese balloon was destroyed, Beijing refused to answer the call from the US Secretary of Defense. The Biden administration humiliated itself and danced with wolves.
Yeah it surveils the weather you fucking morons.

This is a “award winning journalist” folks.
The TALKING HEADS on MSM can keep telling me that the balloon fiasco happened three times under PRESIDENT TRUMP all they want! I’ll just say you can’t fool all the people all the time!!!! The boy who cried wolf scenarios comes in to play eventually!!
Your continued HATRED For the man is APPALLING!  Keep deflecting and defending joey!!  Your outright hypocrisy continues to show exactly who you are!!!!!
😂 No wonder Americans overblown about the stupid weather balloon from China. Do you think you can explain to this person how the phone works? #us politicians 🤣 https://t.co/Xn1W6D6udE
The U.S. with over 8xx billion dollars “defense” budget and pretty soon it will be a trillion dollars 
I won't even try! 
My answer would have been, "Perhaps you should ask Apple, who are not us!"
American politicians should already know by now that most of the US businesses do not and will not give a straight answer. It's always a maybe, depending on further details.
The answer is 'no' because that is iPhone, meanwhile only Android phone can be tracked by Google. Both those politicans didn't know what they were talking about.
What is now to stop China from sending a balloon over with a bio weapon? Now that they found out Biden will let one fly over the whole country.
I read on Business Insider that it was one of our own.  Who knows?
It definitely looked like a cheap thing. It is hard to believe it floated half way around the world.
Nobody can convince me that the Chinese need balloons when they have satellites.  Weather balloons, maybe.  I'm very skeptical of all the noise.
I’m wondering also. This thing looked cheap.
How about an EMP? It would take out all electronics in all of North America.
They have not stolen the technology to do it yet.
PRC already released a devastating bio weapon. Balloons may have been one of the sources already.
Or an EMP that would set us back to the 1880s with no electricity, no cars, no computers, no fuel pumps, no lights, no heat…think about it. After a few weeeks when half of the pop. kills the other. China could waltz in and take what they wanted
Or ANY country? What's to stop them? Absolutely NOTHING...
Did you see the balloon from China in the sky making the recent news!? …and did you see the words on the balloon? Here is my parody painting of the Chinese balloon!   #mattstarrfineart #artists #China #Chinese #balloon #chinesefood #fooddelivery #deliverfood #weatherballoon #art https://t.co/hbQTAbUolr
bring the food or just turn around, Chinese spy balloon
How weak America must have seemed to China under trump! Three spy balloons flew in from China while trump was in office! He did nothing! Thank God for President Biden! 🇺🇸
No balloons from China flew over the United States in any way, shape, or form while I was President. If they did we would have shot them down, immediately! -DJT  2/7/23
Wow, your Lord and Savior, the Traitor-in-Chief, denies it, so it HAS to be true!  #MAGACult
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THE BALLOON WASN’T FROM CHINA? YEAH… JUST REMEMBER THAT!
D—0—D
DARPA
gotcha
FAKE NEWS
Your #Mom must be #Fake Because she was making this noise last night like EeeeeRrrr EeeeeeRrrrr EeeeeeRrrrr
Why would China take the blame for them? And play an act as if it was theirs??
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION… WHERE DID YOU HEAR CHINA TOOK BLAME? GO BACK TO THAT SAUCE AND QUESTION THAT! THEN LOOK FOR “OTHER” SAUCES… THEN COME TO YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS… BUT KNOW, WE MADE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THERE ARE STILL SOME BAD ACTORS TO DEAL WITH… ALSO, WHO RUNS CCP?

"On Monday, Deputy SoS Wendy Sherman led a briefing on China’s balloon espionage for some 150 people from about 40 embassies... The department has also sent to every U.S. Embassy 'detailed information' on the espionage that can be shared with allies and partners."
"Between our disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, the China balloon fiasco and emptying the terrorists from GITMO, Biden and company display weakness, betrayal and lack of resolve on the world stage" -- Lt. Col. Brian Sullivan, former FAA Special Agent
We now know spy balloons from China never flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Biden apologize tonite for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did not happen under Trump?
Of course not!!!
Sadly, I think you're right. And that is why the China spy balloon flight which Biden allowed to proceed for 7 days must be commented on every day and never allowed to "disappear" like the story of Jared Dowell disappeared "BAM" ... just like that
When will trump apologize for this?
I having hallucinations thinking he would admit and give Trump a shred of credit ??
No if he mentions it at all he will double down on the lie.
There were 3 brief incursions, but they didn’t come close to flying over the country coast to coast. That balloon didn’t pick up anything the Chinese satellites and spies haven’t already mapped out. It was a diversion and a bully probing to see what they could get away with!
You've got some extra words in that tweet there, friend.   "We now know spy balloons from China flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Trump apologize for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did happen?"  Fixed it for ya.
He also said inflation was happening under Trump.
After tens of thousands of acres of Missouri farmland have already been gobbled up by Chinese oligarchs, does Josh Hawley really expect Missourians to believe a balloon was his tipping point on banning China from owning our farmland?  In an election cycle? https://t.co/L9jBcpXt3t
Drinking song for Senile Biden SOTU  🎵I'm gonna swing from the China spy balloon From the China spy balloon I'm gonna fly like a China spy balloon tonight 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink Throw 'em back till I lose count🎵
Exclusive: Chinese balloon is part of a vast aerial surveillance program run by the People’s Liberation Army. The spy balloon effort operates in Hainan province off China’s south coast and has for years collected military intelligence, U.S. officials said. https://t.co/R2LsRLD9GH
But 50 retired intelligence officers have said that this is a Russian hoax!
what ??? is america butt hurt that china has a low cost surveillance system that makes american satellite  systems look excessively expensive ,
No it's not
If you guys had the Watergate story today the headline would just be "Nixon Officials Report Nothing Amiss" / ""Everything A-OK," adds Haldeman."
Alright, so how many spy satellites does the US have ?
Why Use balloon when they Have Actual Satellites seems like a lot of CRAP
source: i made it up lol
It's time to be afraid, everyone! Your government said so
Why didn’t the previous administration take action?
so much exegeration
"..former vast aerial surveillance program?" Now that the word is out, they will just be a world league of free practice targets wherever they drift! China wants balloon back! Once our security group lab is done with debris, why not? Barrels or dumpster container?
What could a balloon do that a satellite cannot?
And apparently the balloon got in through Alaska all the way across Canadá and got into the US through Idaho.   And it’s path is the same as an airplane so all the satellites we have couldn’t detect it. And it can only go 60mph.   Oookkkkkk
Might as well let FIFA run this country. And get salt bae to be president. At least he gets to be places a regular person isn’t allowed to.
Something like this went over my head once
No doubt.
I wonder if somebody will report there weather balloon is missing followed by an embarrassing silence.
So you’re saying the situation looks like THIS — only they’re balloons?
Weather balloon will not fly to the high altitude that don’t have weather, there is doubt it could have carried some political dissidents ?
I am shocked, just shocked! that a major nation tries to collect military intelligence on other nations. Good god folks we need to get a grip. This is expected, has been detected, and our military will adapt. It is arrogant to assume only we can conduct intel.
When I looked up at the balloon, I told myself, fuck, what a waste, all the advertising spots worth millions.
So…what.
And they're upset that the US don't like it. Seriously, China needs to be ignored and sanctioned. Greatest gaslighting abusive nation the world has ever seen.
Cow jump over the moo
Weak US President are selling US people data to Devil Communist Country, so disgusting
All your spying is belong to Orange Balloon  guy and his fellow traveler Xi
It is really a kind of art to write an article with so much garbage and propaganda. Is there also solid evidence or just more phrases?
You have it all wrong.... China was simply helping #Biden find additional classified documents he's left all throughout America... They have altruistic motives. #ChinaSpyBalloon
Shoot them down good training exersise
Y’all will say anything to get us to go to war.
Most of the tweets under this topic were written by Chinese people who defend their CCP.
So they government spy on us on the daily basis and why they don’t show the apparent device.  Why is it we gotta take their word for it.  Iraq all over.  We still waiting to locate the WMD’s the Hussein had hidden in his kingdom.  BS news.
so what？it sounds like China is a prostitute while America is a virgin.  LoL..
They ran it right over Conus, because Biden is a joke

This is a lie.
Weak clueless idiot Biden
After the Chinese balloon was destroyed, Beijing refused to answer the call from the US Secretary of Defense. The Biden administration humiliated itself and danced with wolves.
Yeah it surveils the weather you fucking morons.
Shoot them all down.
With all the technology China has you want us to believe they were using a balloon anyone could see with their naked eye? LMAO GTFOH
I am beginning to think Biden needed to get permission from China to destroy the balloon 🎈!
You know he did he a puppet for the CCP
https://t.co/x4O7cFvRNt  Just in case you were wondering folks   Trump created a task force protecting us from the threat of China's spy balloons,  but Biden immediately shut it down, calling it racist... 👇👇👇
CORRECT! Trump would have answered the spy  balloon this way..
I'm down with that
DC Enquirer is dogshit.
I wouldn't say that
Nobody asked you.
It’s the difference of a true President verses a habitual liar fraud and thief!
Funny how trumps DOJ task force missed 3 Chinese spy balloons while Bidens administration detected, disabled and shot one down...
Yeah… I’m gonna need a source for your preposterous claim there bud.
Shocker
Socialists don't think .....
Disgusting
Now, these liars are claiming, baloons invaded during Trump Administration !
Why did he let 3 fly over and do nothing
Trump 2024
Shocking.
Beijing Biden is a genius!!
Where is Space Force and Airforce?  It's their mission to protect and defend us. Too busy worrying about pronouns?
Who.. ?
Wait wasn’t the balloon white
So which one is in china's payroll
Still waiting for him to be impeached, arrested all of the above
He listens to everyone but the American people. Xi has control over Joey.
Mr. Jeffries. It is time for you to take your stand, move us. Please move us, move us, gang structure of your backbone lined up with your structure under your mind with God, and start your movement no longer at the house Negro but become the Negro leader. Thank you.
TDS everything he did must go!
F.J.B. !!
Not wondering...have no doubt that he looked out for the best interest of American people
Same thing happened with Covid when he wanted to stop the planes coming in from China
So now we're protecting the rights of spies??
Lol that photo edit on Brandon is hilarious 
No surprise  there, BUY-DEN  canceled  ALL OF TRUMPS ORDERS HE COULD!!
Are these the same spy balloons he says didn't exist?
Truth!
Joe Biden
So be knew ?
Gotta stop calling them balloons, they are unmanned aerial spy ships, or craft, or vehicles, or devices. Calling them "balloons" trivializes a serious threat to our security.
Yeah. I'd say he's compromised. Probably throughout most of his political life.
Well, it was a white balloon!  Come on man.
Call it compromised
Oh of course!
Just in case you were wondering.
Joe sucks!
LMAO  no he didnt  
Let's go Brandon
Wonder why
After it went almost all the way through the US
Why hasn’t this senility on steroids been impeached?
Yea ok and what profit did Trump get
Trump is a racist helloooooooo anybody home,
I'm sure China instructed Biden to shut it down
If you wondering, I’m still with Trump. I still trust and believe in my faith in God that he knows how to help us. As for Black people we are the independent party. We’ve been so many frightened, that we bagged up under the democratic party. Thanks for Mr. Obama, thank you!
Alzheimer’s Joe IS a Chinese asset!!!
Trump stands for Americans, Biden is for Biden!
Joe Biden is the most racist President Ever!!
Biden has always been a Chinese Mole
Biden is The Manchurian Candidate.
I seriously don’t know how we let someone like Joe Biden into office.
rematch can't want . trump going  chew him up and spit him out.
Biden and the democrats are racist against us all,  they only care about the power to control their deplorables and Walmart people with lies for their votes.  Can't trust liars.
I love how the left screamed that Trump was a dictator and deranged, that just about describes good old Joe!  We have a communist trader in the WhiteHouse and that’s just the nice part!!  Wait til you find out the ugly side!
Your correct. China is steeling technology from universities that are doing research for the government. They are steeling intellectual properties from US industry. Biden stopped the fbi from investigating and stopping this.
Ef  Joe Biden. He is a coward and a communist
This imposter is not the real Joe Biden
He because Biden is a Commie Traitor
Hold Biden accountable. Impeach sorry ass
Biden is a traitor an agent of China and should be arrested and put in prison for the rest of his life
Biden took all safety measures away that Trump had in place. Look where we're at now. In debt, left good ppl in Afghanistan, Record Inflation, Open Borders, the most Divided Country in History. The Biden's are looking more and more like Double Agents. He's on the side of money.
But there were Spy Balloons during Trump as well. So what exactly was this Task Force doing?
President Obama created a task force to protect America from a pandemic, and Trump shut it down. Big Mistake!
Pedo joe is a communist and needs to be charged tried and convicted for treason. Now we have spy balloons wow we have sunk to a new low in this country.
Biden is scared to death China will out him and his family for all their influence peddling...
BUY-DEN  &amp; most  in his administration  are paid for by China Communist Party, especially  Tony  Blinkin!!
What do you expect from. senile Joe
biden don't know a racist form a balloon.
Possibly impeach Biden “ the liar “ and remove him from running this country
We love President Trump!!!
WE MISS YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!MAGA
Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46 Impeach #46, IMPEACH #46
Everything about trump is racist.
Biden the  is lost.
President TRUMP was a true American hero!
China is getting what they paid for.  Joe's all in.  For China !!!!
Obiden better get his head out and start thinking about saving our country in the history books Obiden will be the worse president in our history
Bullshit.
A countries protection against foreign enemies is not racist. The person who invented the word racist was probably a racist
Because him and all the rest of his morons ARE TOTAL ASSHOLES !!!!!!!!
Biden is a twat
Want real news? Watch The Duran; Rubin Report; REDACTED; Joe Rogan; News Altlas; Rebel News; Clyde do something; JP Reacts; Dr. John Campbell; MOATS; Monket Werx... Then listen to MSM and see who is full of BS...
This goof shut down everything that was working, only because he doesn't like Trump. Oh, and he's an idiot.
Twitter has SUSPENDED the account of Montana Senator Steve Daines for using a HUNTING profile picture!  They claim it glorifies violence against the Animal Community. At least until Elon Musk gets involved: Someone needs to be fired.
He's a demented fool. China is our enemy.
Unbelievable stupidity
Im not sure if this is true, but if it is you can quote me……..’bwahahahahaha’
BIDENS IS AN ASSHOLE !!!
Joe is an idiot. Worst fake ass president ever.
The world now realise why the majority of decent fair minded Americans voted in record numbers for President Biden the most popular President in American history especially after his emphatic State of the Union address! Schadenfreude!
I am not sure if this is real news, might be fake?  But what isn't fake is that moron Biden unraveled all the policies that were MAGA starting with Keystone, and immigration.  If Trump's name was associated with sometimes brilliant policies Biden unraveled them. Why? He's a hack!
Moronic post
A balloon carrying an insurrectionist.   Totally fitting.  No different from that China balloon.    Where are the Jewish space lasers when you need them?
Only a Traitor would think this was funny! That's why there is a Cult behind her! This is not American! Trump had 3 balloons from China and didn't let you know. That's what you like! Undercover information you should know. Pure Asinine!
WHY ISN'T FOX NEWS LETTING TRUMP CALL IN AND GIVE HIS OPINION ON THE CHINA BALLOON. I THINK ITS ALL PAUL RYAN, ANOTHER RINO TRUMP HATER WHO IS NOW IN A POSTION OF POWER AT FOX! WE WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR REAL PRESIDENT!
Yep! RyN won’t let him! Just like during the 2016 campaign.
Turn off FAUX
Because he hides secret documents and tells nothing but lies. He is irrelevant
RIN0 ryan is on the faux news board!
fox WENT TO THE DARK SIDE LONG AGO  CAN'T DECIDE IF TUCKER,HANNITY, INGRAHAM,  ET AL ARE STAYING ON TRYING TO RIGHT THE PROBLEM  OR IF THEY'LL JUMP SHIP WHEN THEIR CONTRACTS ARE UP
Ryan is, and always will be a democrat loser, regardless of what letter he mistakenly puts after his name.  He’s useless
I’m not planning to watch Beijing Biden’s crappy State of Disunion tonight on Fox News and I pray that their ratings take a nosedive DOWN into the toilet! I don’t like Paul Ryan!
Has been in position at Fox for 4 or 5 years and nobody did anything
Why does anyone watch Fox?  Why does anyone actually pay to cable TV?  Save your $.
Paul Ryan is married to a wealthy Dem, should tell you everything about this Rino!
If an individual hadn't spotted China's balloon from a window and then took a picture of it, the American people would have never known. That should concern every American. You have to ask, what else is the Biden administration hiding from the American people?
To that point...
What about the 3 trump hid from America?
Democrats act as if it was great they waited to get the technology from it ! Only all that could had been done long before it’s trip across our nuclear facilities !!!! And with LiDAR and ground penetration radar I’d say they have some great information ! If we didn’t block signal
Good call !!!!!!!
There were no identifying marks on it. They could have easily called it a weather balloon and 99.999% of the GP would have accepted it. That said, it being a Chinese balloon could have been the actual lie the way this administration loves to create false flag events.
Obviously they are hiding so much to have to be paranoid enough to put fences up!
Transparent as Mud
That's A Scary ASF Thought 
We be all over they ass!!! 
Premiere Xiden Regime use lies, deceit, propaganda, and coercion to poison, maim, and kill Americans
Notice how quickly &amp; quietly the China spy balloon has disappeared from the MSM news stories.  It's like it never happened.   Biden put the U.S. in harm's way by allowing China to electronically spy on us, then lies about it, then blames Trump &amp; the event has vanished altogether
There was a lot of repeating the same old lies about the supposed 3 Trump ones. Has it died down? This morning it was ridiculous. Maybe they're quieting down for State of the Union tonight.
Yeah..but they quietly let some guy outta gitmo
He sold our country to China. It was probably a ReMax balloon..checking out where they can station their army.
Was just chatting with my brother about all this. We see that when China decides to pull the trigger on us, the battle will then be full on, but not a second before God allows. Man has not quite filled the earth with sin yet, not quite.
Only a Democrat can get away with being senile, hiding in his basement, falling on stairs, falling off bikes, telling lies about his son and getting arrested, 9% Inflation, $5 gas, calling out for a dead woman, let China spy on us..and expect media to still be your cheerleader.
Yea and during that time that it was fresh in our minds they tried to make people believe that during our President Trump time in WH there were 3 balloons flying around what a crock of shit DemoKKKrats believe we are feeble minded like their supporters and believe n e thing said
A US military intelligence report from last year on China’s use of high-altitude balloons, mentioned sightings in Hawaii and Florida during the Trump presidency..  The report is the first indication that the US military was aware of Chinese spy balloons during Trump's watch.
Quit lying 
1) either he didn't care because he was trying to get them to help him get reelected, or 2) they didn't trust him because he had been itching to use the nukes.
The BALLOON was in our airspace. That makes it ours.  Hearing differing stories. Pentagon said the balloon was blocked from getting information yet we were watching it to see what information China was learning. If we had them blocked how did we study what they were looking at? https://t.co/UTruuDQgih
So by that rationale if we fly a military drone over a sovereign country's airspace without their permission it becomes their property?
If it lands on their ground after they shoot it down, it becomes theirs. They don't give it back.
Yes and how have we retrieved important data, when they haven’t recovered it out of the ocean yet! We are being lied to over and over again
They are probing the wire. Chinese think / plan long term, not like us planning profits only for the next quarter. How many electrical substations did they gather info on, Military bases, comm towers, water supplies, the list goes on. Don’t let anyone downplay this event.
I wonder if Joe's speech will make him look heroic over the balloon pop ,    Or will the speech run Trump down cuz he had balloons too ,  Or bothe ,
Laughter so the Pentagon said that did they? I say they were caught and blamed China.
The balloon was on DOUBLE SECRET Probation
Makes perfect sense
google earth can do.the same and better...
The Chinese version of events makes sense.  Somebody is lying.
"The Chinese side regrets that the airship mistakenly entered the United States due to force majeure."
Obvious answer: Pentagon is full of incompetent liars.  Former cyber warfare officer here: Pentagon can choose to let all signals to satellite relays &amp; intercept or jam all the signals—they can’t do both. If they were smart they could jam and inject false data, but they did not.
Democrats say the dumbest things, contradicting their own “stories” at every turn. When will the world see the truth?
The dems are so dumb!
Well, Tucker Dumbass Carlson said there were explosives on board. Where in the hell did he get that info?
Lets send it Back!
It’s just an innocent balloon… #SOTU https://t.co/Q6saJYqcp8
This is great! We need all GOP carry in white balloons tonight lol 
White balloons &amp; white hoods— sounds about right.
I thought white hoods were southern Democrats. Checks history notes… yes turns out Between 1877 and 1910 the KKK fueled Democrats' push to establish one-party rule and Jim Crow. Loyal to the Democratic Party. Source -
Kindly please resign and go fuck yourself, thanks 
This is a “award winning journalist” folks.
Hard to believe that this is one of the LEAST embarrassing moments of yours.
Is someone triggered?
Yes. MTG
Performative nonsense.
thats your entire life.
He bought an $8 check now he thinks he tweeted something lol.
i literally tweeted something.
Why is everyone so jealous that I have 8 dollars today? I don't say shit about yall spending 80 bucks on whippits and ketamine.
Don’t complain about gas prices than.
Than? The two aren't related, weird.
Imagine being so anti-American you celebrate a Chinese spy balloon. This is who the gop is.
Bring that into the chamber tonight!
Yes! And , : bring a sling shot!
When I see you all do things of this sort, I have to remind myself that most Americans read below a sixth grade level.
You’re a clown show. Theater. And unsuited for your position. This is an awful derailment of leadership. Meant to make a joke of our congress. Petty.
 lost cause
For that metaphor to work, the Defense Department needs to be following you around, jamming your transmissions, &amp; then remove you from office over the Atlantic.   Since you posted this, obviously your transmissions weren’t jammed, so it’s just cosplay.
And this is why Rob is paid the big bucks. Before Marj even farts an idea out of her hear Rob knows how to silence her.
Also I’d love to see Marj removed from office over the Atlantic. Thanks for that visual. Made me smile. Something to dream about
Wow...I just listened to him talk for almost a minute and a half and somehow not make a point...
Well you must be just a little slow then! Let me surmise for you…he was saying MTG should have the song ‘Duelling Banjos’ from Deliverance playing as she walks around cos like the characters in Deliverance, MTG is a little backward &amp; hence a danger to society  Hope this helps 
I'm not slow at all. I heard what he said. He has no point. Everyone in congress is backwards af and hence a danger to society.
Erm, as I’ve already pointed out to you, he HAS a point. His point is that MTG is backwards. And if you think everyone in congress is ‘backwards af’, why wouldn’t you attack them instead of attacking someone who is actually stating/supporting your point 
Because the guy literally had nothing to say other than "banjo music".
But you previously sad he didn’t make a point, yet now you’re saying he ‘literally had nothing to say other than banjo music’   So he DID make a point then, didn’t he?#  Soy une pertador!
Hell at this point whatever you say man.
Where would Marjorie Taylor Greene be without cameras following her around wherever she goes?
A lot more than Joe Biden does at least she's not putting money in her back pocket
Eh MTG’s made an enormous amount of new money since running.  But it doesn’t even work as a joke to compare Biden’s workload to hers, and think the POTUS works and accomplishes less.
Don't bother, I don't think people who post trigger statements like this care. They just want a rise, move on I say. 
Well said
This State of the Union address will be  lmfao… We are live until 5pm eastern call in and tell us what you think about tonight’s address.
I think the dude with the long beard should cut it off. It’s gross and unsanitary and all I can think of is hair getting into food!  
That’s your defense lol   Good one!
Excellent!
Oh my god
You are not a serious person
I mean, if your IQ is 79, this is high concept art.
No music today?
You absolute buffoon.
It got your attention!
So would a nun farting. Doesn't make it great.
GOP dog and pony show before the entire world
It never got balloons in the wild so it’s super excited.
Totally on brand for you Marj, since clowns are known for their balloon tricks.
It doesn’t get more stupid than this.
Weren’t you just bitching that you hated your job because it keeps you too busy?
Yet we never actually see her do any work.
Some wonder why no one takes you seriously.
I hope your voting constituency watches you spend tax dollars to film your little  self- promotional middle school theater pieces.
Love Nancy!  She's awesome 
You’re pretty much a joke
On 9/11 expect MTG to side with Al Qaeda by carrying around a model of a jet plane. Oh wait she thinks 9/11 was fake so there goes that. But in any event MTG is the true leader of the GOP.
Ohmygod it looks like an SNL skit about how vacuous and shameless and stunted you and your party are   Nice touch that the balloon’s white 
Be careful! of heat seeking missiles, or Lazers from Satellites!  It's astonishing how low the bar is nowadays! to be a Republican!  Ms Gazpacho other than doing Peachtree experiments! what have you done for your constituents since being in congress?  Shame on the Republicans!!!!
Kinda like the “innocent” people that stormed the capitol on Jan 6.
Now all 2nd graders in America will know they, too, can become a Congressperson.  Not when they grow up.  Right now!
Joker is Xi Jin ping and the  plane  is the F22 that blew the weather balloon !
She is the bomb!
Excuse me sir...very smart move on her part
You should fire whichever staffer convinced you this wasn't sad and pathetic.
Why?  It was probably her idea. You think she has sane members of her staff?
Good point. If there are, they must not want to lose their jobs.
this kind of crap is just more proof that you don't consider your job to be a lawmaker. You're in DC to make noise and stir up shit, that's all.
Newsbreak: that's why they are all in DC.
I want to think otherwise but sometimes it’s hard.
Get help
Great balloon
Weird to see something full of more air than you
MTG “is” full of hot air soon to pop
Legend
You are such trash. You bring daily shame upon Georgia. Shame on the ignorant fools who voted for your trash ass.
 That from a state that elected a stroke victim that doesn't even know his name but wears nice clothes.  
#MAGAMorons
You're a balloonatic.
Her next date
Anything for Snapchat
Y’all are terrible at this.
Then why aren’t you following me? 
At least I use my own profile pic. And my own name, dude
Seeing my government turned to this kind of chaos &amp; immaturity . I’d say a 8.5. But holding out cuz I’m sure I haven’t seen the peak of it.
I’m not offended. I just think you idiots need to get a life.   And no, loser, spending all your time furiously trying to own the libs isn’t that.
Be careful.  Lots of triggered alpha male snowflakes stroking their tools. They could be cowering around the corner with $500 shoes and tiny play military pack.  Disgraceful.
You go  clown
I like your statement!
The balloon is so much smarter.
Nobody thinks you're clever.
It's just a sad little troll...
Lmao 
Unintelligence balloon.
It’s really kind of you to use this balloon to remind us all of how thoroughly, safely, and effectively Biden destroyed the Chinese spy balloon. Really big of you to reach across the aisle and celebrate Biden’s badass move this week. Thanks, Marge!
I hear you saying it is ok to not prevent rape if you do something after it happens?
The balloon is innocent. You are not.
Embarrassment of a human.
You’ve finally found somewhere to store your brain.
Clown
Then why bring it to the state of the union address?
You are obviously not serving the american people and only looking for attention. Such a disgrace.
It Chapter 3???
Do you ever do actual work?
I see two white balloons.
I see 3
Bag of Rocks
And it's smarter than you.
Congratulations on totally acting like a grown-ass adult last night. Unfortunately, we’re all out of the Desperate Attention Meals, so you’re going to have to order something else.
Marjorie Taylor Greene: Proving to America that she indeed CAN outdo her previous day’s stupidity and adolescent behavior. Well done, clown!  
you definitely are part of the circus... have a glass of koolaid
There's nothing innocent about what you do. Your behavior is antithetical to what Congress should be about from harassing teenagers &amp; your colleagues like &amp; to being a Neo-nazi sympathizer, that balloon represents your inflated antipatriotism #SOTU23
The Qanon spy balloon. And a white balloon.
If they think it’s a spy balloon, I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn they might want to purchase.
Look! A buffoon carrying a balloon!! Duh that rhymes! Yuk yuk yuk! Classless feckless buffoonery!
I love it.
Always. Be. Trolling.
 Right 
Hell yes.
All Republicans need to bring a white balloon to the #sotu2023 tonight. (Not my idea, someone on here suggested it) I think it’s a fantastic idea!
At least we can move, Canadians have a dictatorship now. What you guys are putting up with is off the charts. There’s a reason that #CanadaHasFallen trended a few weeks ago.
I have Canadian friends and family. Great  free country. Where you people get "dictatorship" is baffling. Probably more like parroting.  Heard it somewhere. You never have an original thought.
I have friends in Canada, and they are not happy.
Well - if they're your friends, I can understand why.
I am so sick and tired of empty GOP performative nonsense.   You are a truly useless embarrassment.
Oh did little Marjorie hurt your feelings again? Grab your teddy and find your safe space. It's just a balloon.
Another way of looking at it is She a representative of the United States of America in the peoples house. She is a disgrace and a dishonor to our country and herself.
I find it amusing that people are ok with politicians making an adversary flying shit over our airspace a joke. State of the Republican party nowadays is truly astounding. Are Republicans pro China?
are democrats? they let the balloon cross the entirety of the US then decided to pop it. after it would have already completed it's mission.  if this admin is going to be a clown show might as well get a few laughs and make fun of them for it.
You haven't a clue what it completed.  It's looking more and more like a propaganda stunt to embarrass and further fracture this nation so divided by stupid partisanship it can't even show a united front on THIS.  And silly opportunistic stunts like this are the reward.
They need to put a circus tent over the Capitol dome for the next two years. GP
Can you imagine how difficult a workplace environment it must be in the Capitol when MAGAts might be carrying weapons to work? I’d pass a law that says you cannot have weapons inside AND isn’t there already a DC law that covers that? Sgt at Arms—Start arresting the chaos caucus!
I am so glad your not my rep .. you’re an embarrassment
And your one as well , letting  the Biden grifters take money from China .  You'll wake up when China drops a nuke on us thanks to Commie loving Joe
An important message from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green (R) GA
Lol she heard me:
Roger, that's an innocent balloon. But, what's the reason for walking with that balloon and a caption said, "it's just an innocent balloon". Over 5000 people have died in an earthquake and where do you get this type of negative energy? Is that why you got elected?
Missing the camera array and explosives.
Clown show!
LOL, touché! They COULDN’T take down your balloon.
The response by Russian state media, closely aligned with China who is manufacturing hyper sonic ballistic missiles spying on our hyper sonic missile research, was trying very hard to dismiss the balloon as a benign clearly shows it was very important for Chinese reconnaissance.
It Comes from China  h/t
Good for you MTG!  They deserve to be ridiculed.
Why would I pay for stupidity? I can watch that for free on YouTube.
You can pay for these nuts
I'm sure they're not worth much either.
Or barbecue
You're an amateur.
Which is it barbecue or Wendy's
I freaking love her!!!
So you're the one.
Which is being carried through the halls of Congress by a hateful child.
Why is this weirdo allowed to do this and not "escorted" out of the halls of Power! Only in America. 
You forgot "whispers"
I really hope more of you are doing this lol
I know you think this is clever. It's not.
 I love this woman 
I like her most of the time. This stunt is funny 
It’s stupid.
An innocent white balloon that tells the story of a weak “commander in chief” buffoon.
yes trump was
Be great if McCarthy had this sign 
Make sure you add the:  Fang Fang  Eric   via
I love Ana Navarro; this is where I got the spectacular photo of the Dizzy Clown MTG! It's PERFECT!!! The clown's clothes look better of course. 
I'm more afraid of the clown on the left
Ha I love her  
All republicans should show up to the SOTU with their whore balloons 
Almost show time! #SOTU
That’s our lady!
Can I just get cheaper eggs?
She just proved it with her Ballon trick!
The balloon is the smarter one.
You forgot to wear your clown hat
Look at all of the butthurt Libs crying in this thread. It's glorious!!!   Mission accomplished!!!
There she goes, swinging that arm. Guess that’s how she walks when she’s carrying things that go 
You win the internet
I admire her tenacity. Breath of fresh air
is big on sarcasm!!! Bring Sarcasm Back and should join as well. Let freedom of speech ring!!!
is that one of the ones that traversed the country during the Trump administration? I mean, it must be, because Biden shot down the most recent one, and Trump just let the Chinese fly their balloons all across America - including Florida!
Oh look!!! The clown is bringing balloons!!
How about you stop with the theatrics and actually do some thing? Oh that’s right because you want to take away Social Security and other things that your constituents don’t want you to do so you’ll continue with carrying white balloons. Amazing that we’re paying your salary.
What should Jesus do?
Damn you just NEED constant attention, don’t you?
I do love how Lauren Boebert is living rent-free in her head though. That little high school drama cat fight a few weeks (?) ago made me laugh. MTG tries so hard to be the alpha, but behind closed doors, you know the [R] party laughs at her antics like the clown she is.
I'm an independent and consider my political ideology center. I just want to say your conduct at the SOTU was shameful and despicable. Even if you disagree with the current administration, you need to respect the office.
Absolutely right and well stated. She has zero respect and that fact is glaringly obvious by her words and actions. In fact, she’s wholly unqualified for her position and is an embarrassment to the very office she holds and should be honored and humbled to serve in.
Place looks kind of shabby. Old paint. When was the last time they checked for led?
Not a fan of this behavior. Be better than those you say you’re against. Hold yourself in a professional manner so people won’t think your the AOC of Republican Party. It seems low class to pull this pranks when you’re in a position of power.  Just my opinion.
You shouldn't be bringing anthrax in like that
. As an intelligent veteran I want you gone.  Completely
Not so innocent. This balloon is indicative of the greatest threat America has ever faced: Enemies from within.
Your a joke
You are so disgusting. There are people in your district starving, no shelter, no meds, no clean clothes and this is what you do? You are pathetic and the people deserve better.
Like the three that flew over Trump's administration.
Less political theater. More results. Please.
Getting ready for your next cheap performance at tonight’s SOTU?
 They can't stop lying
Thanks for the shoutout
And you whine about not being paid enough, do you ever actually do any work?
And this happened
Is that one of the balloons that Trump missed?
Keep up the good work Marj.
You crack me up!  I love it!!!
imagine being this proud of being this childish
Fixed it for you.
Care to comment on your concept of Christian values??
Arrogant MORON!
Libs will never recover.
THIS is who is representing the Republican Party. I’d be so embarrassed to support these people.
Imagine mocking another politician when you are just as corrupt and as useless as them. Name a way you've actually contributed to society with evidence i'll wait.
Wonder what it would be like to have politicians that actually wanted to work for its people than to spend all their time fighting each other?
Elected to represent her constituency and do the right things.  Instead: spends all her time trying to be the most petty, incompetent and ineffective person in politics.  Great work, dumbass.
American politics is such a meme its incredible. Like who does this lmfao
Why don't you do something about the #chemtrails  over your home state #Georgia ? 7:45am yesterday.
Good. You had something shiny to play with while the adults were talking...
I think it’s hilarious that so many forgot the dramatic tearing up of the SOTU transcript by then SOTH Pelosi. On live TV. In front of the watching world.  I think it’s all nonsense on both sides I’m just pointing out evident hypocrisy.
 1 Gangrene should have threeballoons, amirite?  Why? To show her "respect" toward TFG's ties, wheeling and dealing with  since.  But she can't count as that many toes she has
Priceless absolutely Priceless!!!!! WTG MTG......Way to goooooo!!! Love it!! Liberals getting the Splodey head thing in 3,2,1....blast off. But then some won't get it lol.  Over their heads...
I’m not an expert but my Gait Analysis of your walk is that it’s identical to the 1/6 pipe bomber… perhaps it’s time the took a closer look!
Can you imagine taking tax payer dollars to pay a staffer to go get a balloon and the your work day is parading around so you can tweet more?  Sad.
I wonder what we are paying you for.  Why don't you spend time working on helping the American people instead of parading around with a balloon.
Republicans became The Clown Party when they accept Clowns like Trump and this lady
"Puh-leeze, someone look at me!"
The white balloon may be innocent, but those white shoes with that outfit are not.
And they let you use scissors ??? Worrying really
The TALKING HEADS on MSM can keep telling me that the balloon fiasco happened three times under PRESIDENT TRUMP all they want! I’ll just say you can’t fool all the people all the time!!!! The boy who cried wolf scenarios comes in to play eventually!!
Your continued HATRED For the man is APPALLING!  Keep deflecting and defending joey!!  Your outright hypocrisy continues to show exactly who you are!!!!!
😂 No wonder Americans overblown about the stupid weather balloon from China. Do you think you can explain to this person how the phone works? #us politicians 🤣 https://t.co/Xn1W6D6udE
What is now to stop China from sending a balloon over with a bio weapon? Now that they found out Biden will let one fly over the whole country.
Who's to say they haven't actually done it already ?  Juzsayn 
Yes, one wonders.
I read on Business Insider that it was one of our own.  Who knows?
It definitely looked like a cheap thing. It is hard to believe it floated half way around the world.
How about an EMP? It would take out all electronics in all of North America.
They have not stolen the technology to do it yet.
PRC already released a devastating bio weapon. Balloons may have been one of the sources already.
Or an EMP that would set us back to the 1880s with no electricity, no cars, no computers, no fuel pumps, no lights, no heat…think about it. After a few weeeks when half of the pop. kills the other. China could waltz in and take what they wanted
Or ANY country? What's to stop them? Absolutely NOTHING...
Did you see the balloon from China in the sky making the recent news!? …and did you see the words on the balloon? Here is my parody painting of the Chinese balloon!   #mattstarrfineart #artists #China #Chinese #balloon #chinesefood #fooddelivery #deliverfood #weatherballoon #art https://t.co/hbQTAbUolr
bring the food or just turn around, Chinese spy balloon
How weak America must have seemed to China under trump! Three spy balloons flew in from China while trump was in office! He did nothing! Thank God for President Biden! 🇺🇸
I bet he thinks it now looks like he struck out 3 times  And President Biden hit it out of the park on 1st pitch.
Really? Are you kidding me?
No balloons from China flew over the United States in any way, shape, or form while I was President. If they did we would have shot them down, immediately! -DJT  2/7/23
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THE BALLOON WASN’T FROM CHINA? YEAH… JUST REMEMBER THAT!
"On Monday, Deputy SoS Wendy Sherman led a briefing on China’s balloon espionage for some 150 people from about 40 embassies... The department has also sent to every U.S. Embassy 'detailed information' on the espionage that can be shared with allies and partners."
"Between our disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, the China balloon fiasco and emptying the terrorists from GITMO, Biden and company display weakness, betrayal and lack of resolve on the world stage" -- Lt. Col. Brian Sullivan, former FAA Special Agent
You mean Obama. And it’s on purpose. Very Weffy type moves.
It is not weakness. It is collusion. He is a traitor in every sense of the word. So are scores of people in the government. It's not bad one man band.
No one knows about the terrorist that was sent to live in vacation land Belize.
this isnt weakness-this is intentional- its on purpose-and on their point follows BBB agenda of the WEF- ask yourself what is the why-dig deeper
Lt.Col., Former FAA Special Agent, now there is some high level credentials. You only quote the best. 
Let's not forget the invasion at the borders....
 #SpeedupAfghanSivCases
We now know spy balloons from China never flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Biden apologize tonite for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did not happen under Trump?
Of course not!!!
Sadly, I think you're right. And that is why the China spy balloon flight which Biden allowed to proceed for 7 days must be commented on every day and never allowed to "disappear" like the story of Jared Dowell disappeared "BAM" ... just like that
When will trump apologize for this?
I having hallucinations thinking he would admit and give Trump a shred of credit ??
No if he mentions it at all he will double down on the lie.
There were 3 brief incursions, but they didn’t come close to flying over the country coast to coast. That balloon didn’t pick up anything the Chinese satellites and spies haven’t already mapped out. It was a diversion and a bully probing to see what they could get away with!
You've got some extra words in that tweet there, friend.   "We now know spy balloons from China flew over US airspace under Trump. Will Trump apologize for the lies his Admin people told, and admit it did happen?"  Fixed it for ya.
He also said inflation was happening under Trump.
After tens of thousands of acres of Missouri farmland have already been gobbled up by Chinese oligarchs, does Josh Hawley really expect Missourians to believe a balloon was his tipping point on banning China from owning our farmland?  In an election cycle? https://t.co/L9jBcpXt3t
Drinking song for Senile Biden SOTU  🎵I'm gonna swing from the China spy balloon From the China spy balloon I'm gonna fly like a China spy balloon tonight 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink Throw 'em back till I lose count🎵
I'm not a Trump fan. But from the limited information available, Trump did not know about the then-China balloon situation. So, WTF?

When Communist China sent a balloon to spy on Turkey, it was shot down in 18 seconds. Why did you allow it to pass over America for 5 days? You were tracking it from the time it approached and flew over Adak in the Alutien islands. At 60,000 it covered
Fellow #Americans have you caught Covid from the China Balloon.  Has the China balloon affected your thinking.    Ring 1-800-IMDAFT  and speak to I.M Crooked litigation for all your stupid questions.   (This is not a paid promotion). #USA #ChineseSpyBallon https://t.co/tTvfSQMU6D
Speechless
It was the distraction du jour of the spastic political press. But when China and the US didn’t start a war, the lemmings will soon be distracted elsewhere.

This could be a cyber attack from China 🤷‍♀️they did threaten to retaliate for taking down their spy balloon. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
This caused the outage.....
I’m thinking that
Pretty sure it's in house. Elon still needs to get rid of some infiltrators. Chyna has Tic Tok not Twitter. So idk. Bet this would never happen at Truth Social though lol.
 Or #Russia due to #Pipeline story breaking this afternoon.
I think it was probably the FBI.
Its hard for anyone in Washington not to be a Liar when the Commander and Chief is the biggest one,
It seems almost silly the things being done... like an old fashioned "hey look at what I found" white hat hack..
Could very well be
I would suspect the Biden administration before China. Just my opinion.
You’re thinking same as some others. Possible.
You’re on to me!
Biden let a Chinese spy balloon fly over our sensitive military sites before shooting it down after it completed its mission.  And then tried to claim last night that he protected our sovereignty from China.  What a joke.  No serious American is falling for that. https://t.co/zigFshuoDL
Joe Biden is a Chinese proxy. Period.  He was installed in part by China &amp; serves China.  Biden's policies are China's policies, which is why they generally benefit China &amp; punish Americans.  He needed the manufactured balloon fiasco to deflect away from this. The more you… https://t.co/85WHqUUU8a
Absolutely positively without a doubt correct
Hell yes!
"The Chinese Foreign Ministry has requested that President Joe Biden’s administration return debris from the air balloon that the US military shot down off America’s east coast on Saturday, saying the aircraft “belongs to China.”
i put my money on 5 eyes owning it and it started up   from Canada
Boom!
Belongs to China?  I thought they said it was a get away weather balloon from Meteorologists in private industry
Bet it’s returned.
 yeah …. Too bad so sad
They paid his family, now they want the services rendered!!!
Nope!
That's a Big, NO!
He’ll do it. Anything for his buddies.
Send them a pair of the BigGuys soiled Chinese made adult diapers…maybe Xi will get the hint.
Right after we get the USS Pueblo back from China.
Finders keepers...
Finders keepers
Ya, games
It’ll already be being packaged to send back to them!
And like a bitch, he’ll give it to em.
Send them a pile of bull manure
The CCP &amp; Joe sent the dang balloons up to test our EMP Response time - It took 5 days before anyone in America spotted it - Boom - U R Ded! People better wake up and get this fool out of our government!
We'll send you the debrisfrom our missile if you don't stay in your lane
The Chicom Ambassador should be put on the first plane back to China.  Our Ambassador should be recalled.  A US carrier task force should be steaming toward the South China Sea.  Bullies don't quit until you punch them in the nose.
What kind of Leader let’s a spy balloon from China fly over the the Country for several days before bringing it down?
Biden had his reasons for waiting on the balloon
Yea he’s senile
One who has secrets and lots of them!
A corrupt one
The puppet kind.
Here's a YouTube video you might find interesting baby when dealing with the spy balloon
The kind that is controlled by China!
That would be Biden!
A bad one!! Impeachment starting tomorrow!!! jmo
Superpower 
Commendably cautious. Biden can be criticized for many things, but he made the right moves in this episode.
Someone who’s owned by China
The proverbial first shot across the bow. The true purpose of China's spy balloon was to shift the attention from this earth shattering event.
The Brazilian Central Bank and the People's Bank of China signed a memorandum of understanding allowing bilateral trade IN YUAN for Brazilian and Chinese companies, investors and institutions.  BRICS on a roll.
According to Fox News, we are now at war with China because of a BALLOON!  Lol.  Stamp of approval from Putin, Tass and Pravda.
“I shot down the balloon from China”  NYT fact-check: true but misleading: Biden may have given the order to shoot down the balloon, but he did not personally fly the F-22 Raptor and fire the missile that took out the rogue flotation device
I'm going to [REDACTED FOR VIOLATION OF TERMS OF SERVICE]
be a lot cooler if he did

China wants its balloon back  Beijing has called for the US to return debris from its alleged surveillance aircraft, which was shot down over the Atlantic https://t.co/zhq8M19PhR
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has requested that President Joe Biden’s administration return debris from the air balloon that the US military shot down off America’s east coast on Saturday, saying the airship&nbsp;“belongs to China.”
That’s from her Space Laser left over Winter  White collection. It was delivered just in time from the China Spy Balloon
What the hell is MTG wearing?
The Chinese spy balloon was part of a larger PLA surveillance program that targeted many countries including India, and has been on for at least 5 years. America briefed officials from 40 countries, including India. China's response: give our balloon back to us!
We already have a Chinese balloon in Delhi with hotline to Beijing
Ohhhh toh ye climax hai
Bully and wants the toy back.
A few days back I heard earth received some kind of radio signals. Don't tell me it was a balloon made in China.
Tweet while om air !
Mdm Sharma, on your personal grid, U should highlight only 3 interesting articles per day. Firstpost is there for the rest. Too many articles(cooks) spoil the Grid soup. 
Onry weather barroon.. totarry not for spying..
Now the 5 years of information about all countries is in US hands. It’s even worse
I think you need to tell us how much money LIC invested in Adani shares &amp; what is the current value. When shares where on top no one discussed how much profit LIC has made from Adani. Let’s be fair, it’s share market &amp; not fixed deposits. It’s is calculated risk by investors.

Need to find what’s the stuffing in the balloon. All that powdery stuff.
Xi Jinping knows all of your weather now!
Very well explained every content. But, too many content is also distracting at many times. We just want to watch  top 2-3  stories that matters the most. Cut short content even if you don't wanna do just a sake of viewers.
Watched it in First post  You were bang on the point as always you have been  Great u are back
Caught Chinese balloons could be sold back to Chinese Govt for 1 billion dollars each and just imagine this money paying all the debts for that country.
Looks like billions spent by countries, but unable to detect a balloon over head . Unfortunate .
Hey!  Haven’t you ever lost a balloon ?
Again, why does India want to be in BRICS with China?
Yes, all these 40 countries should send spy balloons in Chinese airspace.
China response
WHY ARE YOU AFTER CHINA??  TALK ABOUT INDIA..... BE A NEUTRAL JOURNALIST... IF YOU ARE ONE....
Scrolling through   #ChineseSpyBallon &amp; videos fake &amp; genuine. In the late 70’s Chinese mega were sent to the  Burma border in Manipur . They contained Chinese propaganda pamphlets &amp; photographs of their cities .Friends used to bring the color photos to school.#Nostalgia
China sent out balloons all over the world in 2023 because it is the most advanced spying technology. 
Hahahha.. what shameless response.  Slow clap for China 
Love China's reply 
Seems similar to Operation Rubicon #History #espionage
You are doing great as usual!
Mam pls talk about it uttrakhand is small state so nobody even try to talk about issues this state face it's really heartbreaking to see that the future of uk is seeking justice for paper leak and they are getting this treatment govt is trying to hide the names no transparency
Palki it's called Yellow Peril!
Does the US have a comparable plan?
What was India doing with all the info, no wonder the opposition is full out barging against Pm Modi and his government 
This programme is better than your previous one, you look more beautiful here mam ,must have come from the sense of relief after getting rid of them , you must be suffocating there mam
Are you telling me India Military don't have a surveillance program? 
China is biggest threat for entire world but not bigger then USA
In case of war with China, India must attack three gorge dam with nukes. Many will be intercepted but we just need one to reach there.
Chinese are running out of time.
Big deal. The US has been doing the same.
At least now #America should act consistently against #China
Bro am not a CCP fan or Pro china, I see you making big hoopla and try to swallow meat of USA. You forget to mention USA SPY the most and they go around doing military drills in their backyard.
How could smart Indians fall for American lies? This is a sad ending for Indian civilization.
Spy balloon  Can Indian media do you own research rather than eating CIA's shit? 
Are you telling me you lapped up everything your American overlord serves you?

Is Joe an American - he sure doesn't act like one. Doesn't act much like a president, either.
I believe was following orders from the CCP to keep the balloon in the air.
Yeah, what MAGA wouldn't believe that.
Your motivations are quite transparent!
He’s straight up a traitor enabler.
Most of America does not believe a word that mouth , Steve. You and your GOP folks lie and lie and lie.
They jammed their information gathering capabilities with audio recordings of  screaming
The balloon. Help.
No doubt Mr. Scalise!

Liar.
A very twisted and sad joke!
No serious American is falling for your partisan spin either.
I wish you "back the troops" Republicans would stop disrespecting our military. The President took advice from the pros, and all you can do is complain about that advice.

I saw a map of the world on CNN today, depicting the countries that previous “weather balloons” launched by China had spied on.  It certainly looked like many countries were on that list. Big brother turned out to be China…
535 likes after 6 hours?  No serious American is falling for your lies.
I would listen to military intelligence insted of listen to this.
Trump let it happen 3x plus has patients inn China
What did  you do about the three balloons that flew over during Donald’s administration?
No the Republican Party is the joke the balloon was dealt with get over it
the Pentagon had this thing on screen and the President trusted the Pentagon -- that's not too irresponsible  but you will always find something to moan about, before your party is not in Power again 
President Biden owns Republicans.
Americans were never informed about the balloon flyovers during trump.
You're a joke.   Very grateful for Joe Biden.
No really Steve yr the joke! How’s David Duke?
President Biden handled this situation well. He spoke to experts in the military.  It was brought down safely over the ocean and contents were recovered.  The last guy wanted to nuke a hurricane.  So there’s that.
SO DID TRUMP! Where was your outrage then?
Now talk about the three balloons that Trump ignored
And Trump did it 3x.
You know that's a lie. Get a conscience.
Chicken little
Are you serious? Your loser trump let 3 of them fly over us and he never told you about it. Sit down!
Trump had XI and his group as guests at Mar A Lago or did you all forget? He didn't need a balloon.
Would appear trump and GOP administration never even had a clue……
Interesting… it happened 3x on Trumps watch… you seem to have failed to mention. That and the fact Trump did nothing about it… gaslighting hypocrisy - it’s the GOP way.
You are a disgusting liar.
So you were briefed in the situation room?
I’m serious and falling for that.
Idiot
Serious Americans want to know how certain Republicans who asked Trump for a pardon after Jan. 6, 2021 are still in Congress and not in jail.
They blocked it from receiving anything.
Poor Stevie, no one listens to you.
Steve Scalise volunteers his family to be crushed by falling debris from a weather balloon. How noble.
And what about Trump who didn’t notify anyone or do anything. Save your outrage
I guess the Chinese don't have satellites.
oooops
How many flew over during Trump’s extended Golf Vacation (2017-21)?What did he do about them? A clue: zilch. Where was the OUTRAGE then?
Trump let three of them go and you had no problem with it.
Did you support letting tRump have 3 fly over and remain impotent?
What do you think really happened?
Trump did nothing.  President Biden avoided collateral damage to Americans by waiting til it was over sea.  I guess #GOPsupportsCollateralDamage.
Get help steve...
You are the joke
This is propaganda that hurts our military. Knock it off.
His team actually saw it and tracked it and shot it down.  Apparently team 45 couldn't do the same with several. So, I'm good.  Well done, Mr President!
He did that all on his own ?  Cool
What a ridiculous argument
Ever heard of Google earth ?
Republicans nervous about the Chinese spy balloon caught , this balloon has been working in concert with Trump and his staff, the early signs from the military show collusion with Republicans.   Republicans are lying traitors undermining our chosen government.
Who votes for these clowns like ?
Biden did the right thing.
Do we’re back to the balloon? Where is the plan for reducing inflation?
Republicans got played by Joe and it was hilarious!
Republicans ignored every single crime Trump committed including treason, Insurrection, funneling taxpayer funds to his businesses and dozens more.  And they still think they hold the moral high ground.  A true perversion of reality.
I am a serious independent American and will take the pentagon and president’s word over yours in a heartbeat
This crap from the right is the joke - your party and “ President” did so much worse in these areas - we aren’t falling for the gaslighting
You got owned. #RepublicanClownCircus
These serious Americans are falling for something 
Your entire party has blacked out 2016-20 in defiance to having the American people know the truth about Trump’s misdeeds and plot for Jan 6
Why are you so afraid?  Snowflake
If the Americans blocked China from getting data from the balloon all China would have to do is turn on Fox News or Newsmax and listen to republicans like yourself tell them where everything is and even had map to show how it went across America
I am a very serious American and I believe him and dare I say I don't believe you. can you explain.
Mr Scalise shouldn't you be calling to defund the defense ? Just like you did on the FBI and have your collegues ask for ending the IRS.
You're the joke, deplorable.
Republicans are a joke
Most people believe president Biden and the dod over you.
The intelligence gathering was blocked as you know.
Sorry Mr Scalise… I trust the folks who have Stars and Stripes on their uniform for guidance on how to handle
When you get your “briefing” will you change your tune?
Go out and play some baseball.
I’ll stand with the Military on this one not a seditious politician.
Oh now it’s flying over the military…. U guys need to get ur stories str8
I’m good with his response, his ability to monitor what the balloon was collecting, jamming the balloon from sending data and recovering the balloon. tRump didn’t even know they were flying by. Stop being a drama queen. Now go to work.
Did you check to see if the U2's followed it to monitor it's transmissions, maybe even jam them?  Or do you not think we're capable of that?   Next up, GOP sees how much it cost, starts whining about tax dollars.
You are the joke!
Tell us Steve….what inside intel do you have on the ballon.  You  are a sad political hack and you do not work for Americans.
12 MILLION. TRASH HID IN CHINA , ISTANKA. GOT PATENTS   !!! DOES BUSSINESS  IN CHINA
Too bad that guy was a poor marksman.
Trump let three fly over.
What if it wasn’t just spying? How about spreading biological contaminants over our cities.
You’re not a serious American.
American Military and Intelligence recommended precisely that.  You can no longer recognize serious Americans
No, you (and your comrades) are a joke. You offer nothing but lies to the American people.
Awwwwww come on man. The balloon was just a love note from China to Washington politicians reminding them who is their master
Gaslighting liar.  President Biden actually listened to our military, jammed it, shot it down safely over water and gained a wealth of Intel.
I were at least three under #TheFormerGuy and all he did was play with himself.
So, the president is not to follow the advice of our military Steve? Really.
Trump did it three times and never even acknowledged that it was happening
Now tell us about the three that flew over under tRump!
From a guy belonging to the party that idolizes insurrectionists and puts them on congressional committees.
No serious American is falling for your crap. #BidenDelivers
I was unaware you had serious Americans in the GOP.
It was shot down after military EXPERTS said when.  NEXT complaint……
Nothing burger.
LIAR.  They made it inoperable until they got it over water.
#Gaslighting  #ScaliseIsAJoke
I believe I have caught one of the Wuhan viruses that was aboard the balloon according to am seeing spots.  Please think of me your Republican Jesus prayers which are my only hope.
And Trump did what about the 3 spy balloons on his watch?
Miley is part of it
You guys love to keep up division, I guess you all were in a coma when the Dear Leader was in charge.
Trumpet let it happen three times, Scalise.  Where's your outrage over that?
Serious American here, and I sure believe Biden over you…  the new GOP - party of violence, restriction, suppression of anything female, and lies. Do better.
While trump DID NOT EVEN NOTICE any of the Chinese balloons that flew the same path.  Or was he protecting #TrumpCrimeFamily Chinese bank accounts and trademarks? #GOPHypocrisy #GOPClownShowContinues
Just remember that EVERY DEMOCRAT sent you well wishes when you got shot! Some of them even went to the hospital to see you. And this is how you treat them? Disgusting!
Steve.  Just shut up.  Nobody buys your crap.
Delusional
Because it’s the simple truth and you’re a shameless liar.
You know jamming signals is a thing we do here.
Hey Steve most people (except your constituents who are rubes) know you are a prolific liar
81 million Americans are not serious
And Trump missed at least 3 altogether.  What’s your point.
Safety
Stopped china intelligence gathering
China flew three balloons over America during the Trump years. Not one was shot down.
You know that is not true. Why must you be such a liar.
Biden is a worthless con man fraud thief and he lies
Was it really from CHY-NA!
How was it any different than a satellite? Oh that's right Why don't you stop trying to scare Americans with lies?
Trump let three without even noticing, check mate
David Duke without the baggage says what?
Next time wait until it's above Stevie's house. He'll understand the damage was for the greater good.
SS US Military jammed the signal from the balloon &amp; shot it Down
The joke is you and your GOP buddies who are hipocrites. You all sat idle for 4 years of Trump's charades.
Scalise, the guy who lied about Pelosi when he was standing right next to her you think I’m gonna believe you! WHAT A JOKE!!!!
Give it up. The balloon was properly dealt with. Unlike under the Trump administration.
  ‘Balloons similar to the one that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina this weekend flew over the U.S. at least three times during the Trump administration, according to a senior U.S. defense official.’
These are provable lies Mr. Scalise.   You have access to the information and intelligence that proves this is a lie. Yet you continue to tell the lie.   That's because rEpubLIcanS are made up of LIES.  Seriously though, how do you live with yourself lying like this?  Liar.
Didn't you ask for a pardon?
You are the joke…
Ty   What have we learned from the Hunter laptop hearings?  Biden never directed Twitter to censor, but Trump did. The GOP didn't know the 1st amendment applies to government censorship, &amp; they're learning that accusations aren't evidence #GOPClownShowContinues
Very nice, dear.  Now let the grown ups govern.
Scalia who are you call to that the kettle is black. Look at your actions from 2020 election. Your a Insurrectionist and a conspiracy theorist. Did your boy trump have 3 or 4 balloons fly over the country and didn’t do squat. Want to discuss that?
What makes me laugh is if he shot it down and it killed people they would blame him for that. I understand the job comes with criticism but let’s get real GOP
No “serious American” can take you seriously, Steve.  #GOPGriftersOnParade
These comments show just how little understanding members have of our military capability.
Nor for you either Stevie Boy.
I'm a serious American who is not falling for your fear mongering.
Kevin said hush, so hush
And how many did Trump let fly over? I’ll wait.
So weird that you don't know about the 363 Chinese Satellites that exist. 
Sir- you know better than that. You know what the military and Intel did to combat the surveillance. And they were successful.  Stop The Deceit
Joe Biden is a Chinese proxy. Period.  He was installed in part by China &amp; serves China.  Biden's policies are China's policies, which is why they generally benefit China &amp; punish Americans.  He needed the manufactured balloon fiasco to deflect away from this. The more you… https://t.co/85WHqUUU8a
Absolutely positively without a doubt correct
Hell yes!
China is now demanding the United States return the debris from their spy balloon.  What would you say to China if you were president?
Not going to happen.
Since they maintain it was a civilian balloon they can have the owner ask in our courts for the return of the balloon. If they want to admit it was a spy balloon operated by the Government then we can have a conversation.
No Chance In Hell #IFB
They shipped our Air Force jet back in pieces after studying it. I’d do the same with their balloon.
"Would you like us to apply this toward your covid bill?"
Finders keepers 
Goo waaa fukka yyu sel faa
I’m gonna say Biden does it for his handlers, he’s gonna turn it over to them.
Kiss my balloon.
If Biden does this he needs to be charged with treason. Worst president ever, worse than Obama
Just remember to get out and vote Republican 2024 to send that ass hat packing from the white house. Expecting others to vote him out is not enough.
Voted red last 2 times my friend
Thank you for supporting America! I voted Trump 2016, 2020 and the midterms 2022 I voted straight party republican. Those commies will have to destroy America over my cold dead body.
Did they return our spy plane they shot down a few years ago?
Well, the cleanup is going to cost the country 1 trillions dollars so......pony up the cash and we will hand over your party balloon
I’d say 10trillion.
Yes, my miscalculation, sorry 
This is our current President response to China
Send China the debris from their spy balloon and properly return it.   Here’s how:  1) Make sure to document and dissect everything before returning.  2) Duplicate the technology and make our own.  3) Then return the debris over on another balloon while spying and recording them.
No deal
Pound sand to put it politely.
chi na!
Charge them for freight
What balloon?
I'd fly it over on a similar balloon.
I will have the military do anything you want just please don't send them the information you have on me and my family. (If I was this president that is)
We just say NO
Bad connection. Try again NEVER.
Return the data.
That is putting it VERY nicely. Let's go Brandon.
I try to be polite
This is what I would say.
You read my mind exactly!
Pound salt
Joe: " yes, sir, right away"
Drop it off at 30,000 ft.over their country along with about a ton of fentnyl that they sent here.
Best idea 
Come get it
Sorry, that’s a no.  We own it now.
you return all our intellectual property first.
I would tell them to get lost just like their balloon did.
Piss off
I would say no. It was illegally in our air space.
No words. Just the Clint Eastwood stare.
“Do you feel lucky, Punk?”
GFY. Humm is that politically correct?  Well we could say it in Mandarin.  Maybe it would sound better 
I wouldn’t.
I’d tell them to go pound sand.
Bite Me is what I would say
Here you go!
Lol!!!!!
I'd say to Xi... Right now we're checking that your spy balloon is OK. But what salvage fee did you have in mind?
Pound sand!!
Sure when they hand over all of the surveillance info they collected!
Hey all the technical information/data you need and have them pick it up on their dime.
Top bad. They are getting nothing
Give them this !!
Come and try to take it.
So they admit it was their balloon,,,so the USA should launch a balloon over China and when  they shoot it down we trade balloons
Finders keepers. If they didn’t want to lose their equipment they should have kept it in n their own country.
Come and get it  Then charge for storage
Keep your ball out of my yard.  Sorry, I'm not sorry, but I threw it out already
What balloon?
Come get it.
Finder's, keeper's!
YES, after our mission is completed 
If I were president, we would have much bigger problems.
I'd ship it to them as shrapnel via UPS ─ C.O.D.
No problem we will send one of ours to your country. Just let us have the same-amount of time to collect data!
Dump visits on Thursday and Saturday only
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
“It’ll cost you all our farmland back.”
Is that code for 's condom?
Biden will probably wrap it in a bow and apologize for shooting it down and offer to reimburse.
I got blocked once for what I would say.
Finders Keepers
I’d break out the political prisoners list and start negotiating.
Go. Pound. Sand.
What Debris?
Finders keepers!
Sorry, we lost it ...
Send it to them and lace it with their fentanyl
You mean what would I say after uncontrolled laughing???
finders keepers losers weepers
I’d say no, they sent it so it is now ours. That is all, thank you.
Come get your Joe too!
Send it UPS
Molon labe.
Come and get it.
Come and Take It.
So sorry. We threw it out.
Okay, here’s your baroon
I would give them the middle finger.
Come and take it.
Heck no!
My sky my balloon, this on your watch is a call to which I will not fall for, treat your people better.
I would say there is a 2,000% import tax owned and an additional $2,000% export tax plus the take down cost and shipping is clearly not included. Debris may have few factory scratches.
China established the precedent years ago. They can come pick it up after exactly the same time they used to pull apart our aircraft in whatever disassembled pieces we have after we’ve pulled every debris junk apart.
That plane never flew over China. A Chinese fighter collided with the plane over international waters. They requested an emergency landing.
Correct
I’d tell them they can have it when we’re done looking it over.  Even tell them where they‘ll need to go to pick it up after we’re done with it.
How about "come get it...we dare you"
This is a good time to use the middle  Finger Emoji at em , a first to me. That felt pretty good. Same thing goes to drones without leg tags.  #AmericanAirspace
Elon probably won’t let me say it here
Only after it has been rendered useless
Come get it
If they could just wait a few months they could pick it up on their way in when they invade America.
WTF IS ALL I GOT
Maybe we can return it via a balloon.
F china
Just say no.
You can get it back when we’re done with it.
Chuck Foo Charlie!
I would say to China to go and pleasure themselves.
You sent it to us and we got it. Don’t send them anymore.
Come &amp; take it.
Yea, After we study the equipment and you pay for recovery and crossing our air space in the amount of 1 trillion dollars, in dollars!
Finders keepers losers weepers
Finders keepers!
Can we give you back Biden instead?
Sure, freight charges are $31T.  Priority overnight is $62T.
The main equipment is under the sea, reported lost.
Come get it, we want to talk to you anyway
Send a box of cheap Chinese electrical parts back in a box.
You can have it back once we find all the pieces.
fuk off
No can do they sent it to us now its our information or data lol
It was on our property, it is now ours.
Possession is 9/10 of the law!
Come and take it.
I’d ‘cremate’ the material and send it in an urn.
Tell them to come and get it. Biden will have it in his garage next to the security documents.
“LOL”
What balloon?
Come and get it. 
Nothing.
*Fuck no
No, we don’t back down to terrorist…And, Read this carefully… message brought to you by the American people
Take Ronda instead…she is still full of hot air.
What debri? We didn't find anything
Finders Keepers
Well I would make my own balloon and send it back to them. Problem solved.
Biden will wrap it up in a pretty bow and personally deliver it balloon to China
No problem if you want it, we’ll attach it to an ICBM. Where would you like it to be delivered?!
Beware
Give our land back and our Ports and no more Chinese Police Precincts in any of our Cities!
“Ummmm…no. We really don’t think you would reciprocate if the roles were reversed. Time to upgrade your balloons so you don’t ‘lose control’ over them during the next flight.”
This would never have gotten this far into the US airspace if President Trump had been in the White House.
I'd ask if we could return Biden, Swalwell, McConnell &amp; Feinstein with it.
We don’t have their spy balloon. They said it was a commercial balloon. Someone else must have their spy balloon.
I heard thru my sources that the balloon was all western technology all in English. What do you make of that??
Send us the two hundred million dollars it cost us to locate and recover some parts and we will FedEx what we’ve recovered.
What Barrooon! 
I still remember the U.S. plane they shot down, stripped down, holding the crew hostage til they felt like releasing them. The polite version of my answer is "Oh, hell no!"
Nope!
Send a balloon over to them. If our balloon travels halfway across makes a circle and then makes it safely across to the other side. Maybe we  giving them the balloon back... you don't give it back. You give weapons to Taiwan.
Trump isn't president. No one cares what you or he thinks. Also, Trump is incapable of rational thought.
The CCP abandoned it over our nation. I'm pretty sure the precedent in the landmark Finders vs. Keepers case dictates it belongs to the US.
Biden will probably send it back.
I couldn't speak without using profanity...
BWAHAHAHA. You sent it to us. No returnsies on gifting.
To get bent.
Nah...
Fk off
Now that spy balloon has been retried it is time to find out where English language parts came from which (sellout) business?
Dream on!!!
I would say, sorry mate but we keep our debris as the balloon was made and launched by the dark side of USA
Haw no!
Two words …. 
Pound sand
"Good luck with that."
AHAHHAHHA!
-Finders keepers - Sorry, it was contaminated with a new virus and we don't want to spread it - Captain Blonde Beard took it to Mars - We properly disposed of the lead paint used to make it
And this is the man Kevin McCarthy is inviting to a high-level meeting on US security? 👎👎 Who is he working for? He'll pick up US info like the white balloon from China.
Poor George Santos. If only he had a father in the real estate business, he could've been president.
All Santos is trying to do is wait out for 2 years. Then he can get a government pension.
Everything from China is crap. Except spy balloons🤔🤔🤔
You got that right, junk. Constantly replacing things that should last a lifetime.
Yeah, it lasted longer than anything they’ve ever made
The United States government just reacted hysterically to a weather balloon from China. If the Russians had found out in real time about the surveillance equipment. Would the Russians have been within their rights to destroy the submarine that delivered the Navy SEALs?
I think they would be within their rights.
I know I keep tweeting about the US regime sabotaging Nord Stream, but damn, people THAT IS HUGE NEWS that needs to be promulgated to the world.  The US regime is a terrorist entity that needs to be destroyed.  #Ukraine #Russia #NordstreamSabotage #Kiev
Oh, it's a catalyst. I don't agree with your analysis.
What will happen now that we have “confirmed” who blew up the pipeline?  Will the US pull back in Ukraine? No.  Will the US be punished? No.  Will the US suddenly admit fault? Hell no!  Nothing will happen. They have control of anyone who could. The war will continue uneffected.
We have different views on this issue.  I don't think it's going away.
By Wednesday of next week, no one will even be discussing this.
I will.
You know what I mean…
I do. I just don't agree.
What will happen?
The empire is ending.  It takes time, man. Give it that.
Dude, hoping for something is not the same as predicting what will happen. You can’t even begin to tell me how this will effect things…
I agree. The Navy SEALs have been used over the decades to commit multiple acts of war. The History Channel actually broadcast a story about an act of war committed by the Navy SEALs. Attaching surveillance equipment on telephone lines in Russian waters is an act of war.
You’re just one more cog in the Russian Intelligence Agency’s (GRU) misinformation campaign passing along FAKE NEWS propaganda.
The current US regime was placed in power by a foreign coup. We are victims of foreign oligarchs just like the rest of the world.
Everyone already knows who did it. What is the big deal? Trump sanctioned Nord Stream. Biden greenlighted Putin to invade by among other things removing Trump's sanctions. The CIA reapplied Trump's sanctions. Do we agree it was the best move at the time?
Remember when the US said 'You're either with us or against us' referring to terrorism? They said it with a straight face.
China has said that the US should return debris from the spy balloon it shot down.
The balloon was estimated to be about the size of three school buses and was flying at around 60,000 feet.  Read more details:
This is akin to the guy breaking into your house suing you because he slipped.
Was thinking more like he lost his shoe running away and now asking for it back. I mean what good is just 1 shoe
Very bearish
Lmao, been about 8 years since I've seen this one
5 hours ahead of you 
And we donated to your $AMC retirement fund.
You have earned my follow.
Sure, as long as they stop trying to invade Taiwan. Deal?
About as secure a deal as letting hitler take the Sudetenland
They'll probably do it too
No .  If you don’t shoot the balloon, I bet they will detonate their equipment before they are caught just like James Bond movies 
It’s just a weather barroon 
are we thinking the Chinese have developed a new method of seeing through hangers and listening to conversations from 60k feet when software can get a clearer signal
Wouldn’t be hard with all of those Chinese made Wi-Fi routers in most homes and businesses
rumor has it they requested US pay shipping too
If they do it they should attach a funny joke
I’m surprised Biden hasn’t already sent it back! So they admit it was theirs? And it got way off course? I’ll just say no, absolutely not.
Sure, they can keep the balloon and we’ll keep the rest of it
I thought it “wasn’t a spy ballon”
Once it entered US airspace, it no longer belonged to China.
Interesting position. Does that go for people too, or just their stuff?
The balloon violated international law. It was a clear and flagrant violation and we had every right to shoot it down. You think we should return it?! Why?
In before someone starts citing all the fly craft that the US uses to surveil other countries in violation of international law
They shot them down? Really? Cite please
Good for Iran
It is Wikipedia, which is not a credible source. Regardless, there’s a lesson that can be learned by the US response to Iran that the Biden administration completely ignored. Or maybe it didn’t, which makes the administration stupid and reckless.
Unreal. Someone should teach China the game “finders keepers.”
Who pays for shipping
Mexico
Hahaha hahaha
Come and get it Mother Fers!!!! 
It’s ours we found it!
Lol wut
ccp has a lot demands, joe gonna to satisfy all the ccp’s demands…?
My yard my balloon
cheeky
Lol, yeah, ok buddy
No.  End of discussion.
Because humiliating America is/was the point…
Sure here “zip bag full with debris “
Yeah we will get right on that.
The US:
US: "SPY balloon....?! Do go on, please tell us more....tell us what it was collecting and we will see if we have it."
Alleged*
Fair is fair. They can disassemble the pieces and return it.
Come and collect yourself
As a child we learn early on that if the ball goes over the fence, it is entirely the neighbors prerogative as to whether or not the ball is returned.
USA should send it back. With their own balloons. They can shoot them down too. Easy and appropriate
Two pithy words.
Bruh 
Haha send them a box full of foil confetti.
What even
Really???
They can come and get it.
Fat chance finders keepers
Not even.
Law of the universe Finders keepers get over it china
double it and give it to the next country
Finders keepers
LOL NOPE
Biden farted on it and used it as a diaper
What they smoking on over in China?
Only if 10% for the big guy.
Finders keepers
I'd love to see what they had, must be fun, if there's anything salvageable
Sure, come and get it.
Our own government put that balloon in the air to distract the masses and crash the stock market. Let's wake up folks!
Mash it up in little pieces after analysis.  Then, send it back in our own balloon.
Only if he sends me some general tsos chicken. Almost dinner time.
Not a chance in hell, China.
Come and get it.
 Biden already losing sleep about it.
Come and take it.
How about they send the inventor of the ballon to come get it?
I’m sure the Biden administration will
Come get it
White House confirmed, return just the balloon. We keep the rest.
We’ll return it to them in boxes like they returned our Navy plane in 2001
– here you go
We should sell it back to them. Perhaps 10% of the deficit should be a good number?!
Baby needs a bottle and a bankey and a balloon
Is Winnie the Pooh coming over his damn self to scoop that shit up 
Negative.
China should return all the intellectual property they stole.
they're trolling
Hope our government asks for $31T...
The fud short sellers come up with so positions go in their favour is unreal, is this even true
Lmfao aye bro can we uhhh… still got that hard drive mayne?
China should stop ethnically cleansing the Uyghur Muslims
Lol why would they want a broken weather balloon full of sea water
We should send back w one of our spy balloons 
confirmation now send some
In return for stolen IP? Deal 
Biden right now is trying to negotiate another swap, this time with China. Balloon debri for a Chinese abacus.
The fact that people are buying into this narrative and story is mind blowing.
Certainly. Once it's undergone a complete "Coast Guard and FAA safety inspection and disassembly." We can't have unlicensed balloons flying in our airspace or sinking in our waters with unknown, unregulated equipment onboard.  Figure that'll take a year at least.
Just as soon as they take back their bioengineered virus
this made me literally LOL
Send them a truck load of Trump’s used underwear.
I have too many accounts tweeting the same content. I follow you for content other than this category
Like someone finding a hidden camera you placed in a spot to secretly spy on them and you being like “ya but let me get that footage”.
Tell them if they want it, to come and get it.  We are waiting!
Come and get it, China
The world can always ask China to give us all back our intellectual property back with damages...but some things just aren't going to happen. Shall we all play a game?
Very bullish on bullets and assault rifles. Maybe time to liquidate some NFTs.
They let us retrieve our spy plane that crash landed.    I’m not saying we should return favor necessarily but this is probably part of their logic.    Our spy plain actually resulted in a death of Chinese pilot if I remember the story correctly.   And spy plane had a whole crew
Remember in 2001 when China held a US EP-3 spy plane for 3 months?    The Hainan Island incident. We should be in as much of a hurry to return it as they were.
Why would they want a malfunctioning weather balloon back?
They should do something fun, like return a giant bag of confetti. Then record the Chi-Coms' reaction and put it all on TikTok. What fun!!
Not spy balloon, thats your assumption, without evidence it is a false claim aka big fat lie. A guy with his iphone with radio app standing next to amilitary base, technically can be said as spying. Assumption baseless is a lie
It's all theater. Stop caring. It doesn't matter. Stop falling after the same distraction patterns over, and over, and over again.
They can come pick their shit up themselves
I disagree
Tell them we'll accept their terms if they take Gary Gensler and the rest of the SEC as well.
This news is gettin even funnier every moment, two kids fighting for a balloon 
Umm no
US in response:
Oh, sadly this one is destroyed. We should send our own over there.
Can we return Swalwell instead?? Just as inflated, assisted in spying activities and hates America...
Give them some string and say the rest burned up
Include Biden, Pelosi and McConnell , Deal !!
We will. Right after we reverse engineer all of it
Tell them it should have dodged better like their propaganda video showed
China should go fish it out themselves if they want it back...what crap
 if you don’t want to lose your balloon  then don’t play with it outside #ChinaSpyBalloon
Ok, tell the CCP to give us back our Stealth Blackhawk helicopter that crashed in Pakistan during the bin Laden raid 
Send them a thumb drive and tell them to plug it into a government computer the data’s all there
I throw popped balloons In The garbage
How about we return these hands?
  Deep breath   
Lol so they do admit it was theirs
Hahahahaha no
Bundle it up in a heap when we’re done with it and tell them to come pick it up
玫瑰是红色的，紫罗兰是蓝色的，我不会说中文， 但没有气球给你.
So sassy China.
Lol good idea
China should pay for the salvage from the sea floor
Send it to them via Balloon Mail
Sure. We'll scrub any data that may be recoverable and you pay for the total cost of the operations required to monitor and take it down. Plus S&amp;H of course.
No give backs
Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V ?
$200 million &amp; they can have it back.
Finders keepers
Just a weather balloon,lol
Ship it over on a crate like Ali Baba so it takes 9 weeks to get to you and then it's the wrong thing.
Send it via a balloon!
Ya we'll get right on that
This is the only response.
China doesn’t need to SPY on the United States, you know damn well Biden tells them everything already.
In other news, thief issues lawsuit for attempted murder on his life after being shot by owner of home he was trying to steal from.
I know the CIA, DOD, DHS, and the military are laughing their asses off right now lmao
It’s our parts 
Hells no
It deserves a proper burial.
Unreal
The audacity!
DONT DO IT.  Data is embedded.
Yeah, no.
Yeah ok lol
Is it possible for China to combine UAV, balloon and satellite tech to invent something new?  The UAV is fixed on the balloon and launch attack after balloon arrives in the US mainland.   The best part for this is the wind only blows from China to the US.......
China right now doesn't have enough traditional weapons to attack the US homeland, but can produce huge number of balloons (like the one in the US) and drones(like those attack Ukriane every day) at a cheap price.   feel free to shoot them down with your expensive missiles.
In WW2, the Japanese released 10,000 balloons, only about 10% of which reached the US.  But now, with satellite tech and solar power panel, I believe much more balloons can reach their desination.  Chinese should test this technology and maybe it already did.
i do know there's  UAV for submarine from china.
UAV attached to balloon will be much easier to spot on radar though.
feel free to shoot them down with your expensive missiles.

US downs Chinese balloon, drawing a threat from China. #ChineseSpyBalloon https://t.co/8F4OT6Arv4
Good morning
Very good morning sir 
Good quality CGI.
Ye USA wale paidaishi aise hi hai mand. Only the feel they are powerful 
These Americans think that the rest of the world is a fool. Waiting for BJPians/Andh-bhakts to claim that the spy Chinese balloon was shot under the guidance of our YASHASWI PM MODI.
BREAKING🚨: China calls on US to return spy balloon debris  A high-ranking Chinese diplomat has called on the US to return the debris from the spy balloon shot down over the weekend, saying that failure to give back the parts would be more proof that the Americans have been… https://t.co/0sOxkG6kj4
FYI: US intelligence confirms Chinese spy balloon was part of Global Surveillance Operation to collect information on military sites across the world.
We're screwed.
We no give back spy barroon
Now that's just funny.
Don't worry China. Our current Commander in Chief, General Milley (coup?) made sure that your spy balloon got blown to smithereens, after completing it's spy mission. Milley made sure your spy data is irretrievable. How much are you paying him, anyway?
Spy balloons sure got everyone to stop talking about joes classified documents
Bingo!
Examine it then return it in pieces like they did with our EP-3.
Send it back with malware and listening micro devices. 
OK lets do the right thing. Lets return the balloon back to China. And only the balloon itself. Not the spy module underneath it.
Exactly. They may be able to recycle it and make masks.
Our only response….. 
I wonder if the Chinese would understand  "Blow me".
Finders keepers!
Biden says... Xi, where do I send it to, sir? The US taxpayers got the shipping!
Yeah like how they turned over our plane they made land?
No no no.. that’s not how things work. Yes we are dishonest. Yes, China is dishonest.. who cares, we don’t need to return their balloon.
This isn’t the first time the US and China have had issues.  Maybe it’s time to take a firmer hand with the CHICOMS.
And I am sure Biden is carefully packing it up to send it back to them with a letter of love for Valentines Day!
Um no
Yeah I'll return let the B2 Bombers give it back
I found A Google Loon project balloon I have photos if interested... Very similar to Chinese balloon. I've been on the job for 25 years. If you would to see or visit about tell me how to reach you privately
Well hold on China let them get it out of the sea and they'll be more than happy to hand it over to you that's the way this administration works now
“Dishonest” implies Biden Admin knew about but shot it down to appease public perception? Wow   Literally no out where this isn’t a betrayal to the  people. One lie is worse than the other, and I kinda believe in the conviction in ’s request over the “word of a Biden” 
Sorry can't find it
Finder’s keepers.
Rule 49, "War Booty," declares that all captured or discovered enemy military hardware is considered loot and belongs to the seizing state, unless, of course, either side is willing to publicly declare that neither side is an enemy of the other.
#ChineseSpyBalloon entered our airspace unannounced and unauthorized. Which could be considered an act of hostility. At any time, was communication established, for permissions to float their balloon, during its airtime in #USA space? Seems severely contrived to call out “proof”.
After they got all what they want.
Let me take a dump in the box they said it back in.
What's the saying ... finder's keepers, losers weepers ...
And we will probably do it 
dishonest?  By letting it go over the ENTIRE US first, waiting until it was all done, and then getting rid of it?  Sounds pretty accepting to me.
Hmmmm what kind of deal did Biden and Hunter make and for how much money? He is a traitor and a danger to every citizen of this country.
This administration will probably give it back.
Sell it on eBay
No, I think "Finders, keepers... " now comes into play.
BREAKING: U.S. responded to China's request, telling them they'll return Deez.
Finders keepers
two words  They start with F and end with U
I hope they've been told a hard NO. Once it's been thoroughly examined and of no further use, box it up and store it in Biden's garage.
It belongs to us now……
We need to fly drones over Muslim slave camps in China
When is Joe giving it back ?
Can you investigate whether China has really called all citizens to active military duty by March 1? I have seen reports but can’t confirm validity.
Let's exchange it for the dirt they have on the Biden's
The Chinese can find their spy balloon in Biden's garage with all of the other boxes of classified documents.
If flyover permission was not granted in advance, just keep it.
I have your balloon
Give it back, with bugs attached.
Go...
The only correct answer is...
It'll be ready in ten minutes
Did they understand the process before hand… like any possible repercussions or not?
Let’s do em like we did Japan and get this shit over with rft
But I thought it was a civilian balloon conducting meteorological observations.  So who's the dishonest one here?
Are they giving us back the intelligence from the Afghanistan jets left behind?
You really can’t believe a word of this. I’m not so sure the regime didn’t have the balloon released in Canada to change the channel on joes documents
China making demands. 
My response.
Conflict?!
So let me get this straight we will declassify the ChiComs spy ballon after 6 days but not who shot JFK after 60 years
Never happening.
Or we are going to bring up our dealings with the Biden crime family.
I thought they denied it being a spy balloon? So they're admitting it now? 
hmmmmmm
Just send them a balloon animal.
What spy balloon?  This is just some weather balloon that blew off course.
What happened
Guaranteed, Milley is advising Pedo Joe to give it back:
I think the phrase is: “come and get it”
It’s deep state period unless they name the high ranking Chinese diplomat and cross examine him- remember the 12 Russians that were charged and they showed up in court and the charges were dropped immediately?
No no Pooh Bear.
Why didn’t we just hook on to it bring it down in Alaska 
Dump it in the Marianas Trench with precise GPS coordinates.   It's all theirs if they can get at it.
The US govt being dishonest? How could that be? 
After lifting the Chinese balloon, it turned out that it had a number of Western-made components with inscriptions in English.
Maybe they should keep their balloons on their own property
I wasn't joking when I said this yesterday lol
Prople , they are not going to show us what they are recovering.
Float this over to them
We have to study it and figure out how a balloon works.
Let’s fly our own and see how far it gets. Then cry for it back. Right
Nope 
Our military is retrieving the debris... He has our military doing the bidding of another nation.   This traitor and criminal has got to be removed. He cannot be allowed to remain Commander and Chief....
As much as I’d love to believe my government they’ve shown they’re not trustworthy. Even if they aren’t lying that doesn’t mean the military industrial complex isn’t lying. They’d be totally happy if we burned one of their million dollar missiles every day on balloons
Finders keepers
If they say please, Joe will give it back.
LOLLOLLOL   who do they think thay are???????
why do chineese people act like this?
Never. It's in our airspace illegally. We own it now.
“Finders keepers, losers, weepers”
Send it back with rice rust spores
I claim finders keepers…lol.
Watch we give it back
Idea here,... it was being used to track people they are looking for. Kind of like the police force they want here.
If China is sticking with “its collecting weather data, send them debris of an actual weather balloon that collects weather data.
Send it back the same way. Use a US spy balloon to deliver, taking the scenic route across China.
"..the Americans have been “dishonest” in the conflict."  So China is admitting they're attacking us, or that we're in an ongoing "conflict" at the very least.
Tell ‘em they can pick it up tomorrow, oh and beer is free tomorrow too!
They are spying on us but we are the dishonest ones? Americans are not studpid.
no no me no like to give you back no no to much heavy you go now
How about this?                We give the Chinese back their spy balloon  in exchange for access to the Wuhan lab.
It’s already packaged with a nice ribbon on top en route to China. 
Oh, China. You are really the limit. Hilarious!
We should absolutely agree to give the balloon debris back. Attach it to a bigger balloon and slowly float it over mainland China all the way to Beijing. China should have no issues with that and be grateful for its return.
POUND SAND CHlNA!!
We will be brought to the brink under Biden, at that point, we will have someone step in to bring peace and arrest the traitors.
BUSTING: I’m calling on China to suck my nuts.
Send some ballons into china's airspace with a debris payload.
Someone please tell China that I said to “Go Kick Rocks”. That ballon belongs in Obiden’s basement.
of course they would n our stupid administration will do it
I'd rub my balls on it before we give it back.
We you should float our own balloon over that says GET FKD!
as we previously tweeted, this predicted ballon remnant recovery has zero to do with the sunken unrecoverable payload which was separated from the balloon upon missile impact and is now at the bottom of the Atlantic. smoke, mirrors, lies, propaganda gets it done for whitehouse
I think the believe belligerent rhetoric is a service to Biden so he can save face after letting them recon.  China is big on that.
Over 200 Americans are held in China, many without formal charges, according to Dui Hua Foundation. How about a swap
Too bad
I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden returns it and pays for the damages
Give'em Biden's diaper
Can we just return Joe Biden?
NUTS!
does this "high ranking" chinese dip realize how comical he sounds?  tell him too bad, its ours now.
I think You” is pretty much understood in every language.
Biden will do what Beijing tells him to do.
Sounds like an act of war. Let’s blow China up.
All BS to distract from the truth
Treat it like China treated the EP-3. FFS, can you even pretend to care about this country?
Surprisingly China has acted more angry over the whole thing than we have.
Biden - It's gonna cost ya!!
Biden will probably return it
Biden WILL send it back... with $$
We should grab the radio mic and transmit, "high ranking Chinese diplomat...go f*** yourself".
Just hide it and n Joe Obidens garage.
Can we just send them back a picture of Uncle Sam giving the middle finger?
This is where the US should respond "Go fuck yourself". It is ok someone will translate its for them - no worries.
Uh…fuck you, it’s my toy now
Omg this administration seems to be in bed with china so I suspect sleepy joe will want to give it back, hopefully there is some intelligent people still left and they don’t give back anything!
Study it a bit make it into several manageable pieces and strap it to some balloons and let it fly back to them. Maybe 100 care packages for them to shoot down over their own country.
Give back baroon, no spy.
Come get it bitch.
It’s our balloon so China is totally calling us out knowing we won’t give them this balloon.
Why doesn't the US fly a balloon over China and see how they deal with it.
Here ya go China
Honestly wouldn't be surprised if Joe Biden gives the balloon back and apologizes for taking so long to do so
This is how emboldened the CCP are with biden in charge  Beijing is f***in loving this
Watch, China Joe will give it back
Absolutely! We will attach all the Chinese immigrants and spies and Chinese police personnel that occupied the US in the last few years. Let it all float back where it came from!
Biden I’ll probably send them $100 billion for their troubles
We all know no country would be allowed to fly a balloon over China. Screw these lying clowns!
This is just hilarious. 
Red china wants its equipment back after they said it was only doing non-threatening work. I hope biden tells them to go to hell.
What a joke! No, they don't get their spy balloon back!
Biden may have given the CCP permission for the flyover.  He and members of his family do have friends in high places. I wonder if the balloon carried a virus?
The Chines have been totally dishonest, too. Trying to put a type of aircraft undetected in another country to spy. Let's shoot THEM down.
Haha get fucked China
China you are idiots... You have come up against the bride of Christ in America and we renounced China we rebuke China and we command the head of China and the socialist party of China to fall.. Joe is not our commander and chief. You have no right.
Yea, nope! Eat sh!t Xi!
Fuck them
F China and They're Balloon  They gave us Covid
FJB!!!! FUCK china!!!!
They shoulda never sent that bitch over here. Fuckin China
So now Biden has us nearly at war with China and Russia. But "Trump, he racist".   Can't fix stupid.
You have to hand it to China they have balls to request such a thing. That tells you how much respect they have for Biden and embarrassing him on the world stage at same time.
Fuck those commies, bring it on.
Fuck Them. One word. Wuhan
How about…. Fuck China
I think we should kindly tell them in the most respective way possible to go fuck themselves. 
spy balloons from china! be afraid! don't think! be afraid! https://t.co/FvAw4YpI7m
China has been trying to make its spy balloons more durable, harder to detect and even serve as platforms for advanced weapons.

For liberals who can’t quite comprehend simple writ…  rPOTUS Trump would never have to “shoot down” a CCP spy balloon over America because the CCP would have never floated a spy balloon over America if Trump was POTUS.   iPOTUS Biden is weak and faltering. Our enemies know this.
Lmao hey dumbass 3 balloons from China flew over us during Trumps disastrous 4 years in office.  HE LET THEM! https://t.co/cjrYIZMyPw
40 balloons from China detected circulating the globe gathering intel from other countries, not just ours.
Sounds like a fifth grade class experiment.
lol it very well may be!
Right
*shrug* its what the voices in my tv said
So no weather balloon that broke loose and is drifting off track.  Color me shocked and surprised!
lol, no... they're all right where they were supposed to go.
Low tech, everything they make or do is cheap crap.
“99 red balloons “
Studying weather patterns and gathering Intel for nuclear fallout. So, Russia can get the green light to Nuke when weather conditions are favorable.
That’s not good 
They use balloons because not only can they get intel data up-close at a greater degree of detail, but Also because balloons are docile, and far less intimidating. As such, are more likely to be allowed to casually float through borders.
Nothing going on in North Korea, not sure there have nuke by the Chinese balloon info jk
DC stopped from decreasing violent crimes and allowing foreigners to vote. Also calling out China over the balloon. https://t.co/roxNEnNMvV
Your state is a mess but keep blaming immigrants and China instead of actually doing something.
He IS doing something. He's fighting to disclose the truth about UFOs! He's also fighting to disclose the truth about the Chinese balloon! But I repeat myself.
That's a follow
Other than voting for McCarthy as Chair, you are doing an amazing job. Keep it up!
You need to do more than call them out
He can’t do shit
Sounds like a Good Day for you .
You are a joke!
You accomplished absolutely nothing. If you’re so interested in governing dc (you’re not) why don’t you quit your job, move to DC and get elected as mayor or council person.
Thank you Tim. Glad to have you representing our district. May God bless you.
We're still waiting on you Congressman...
Quit acting like a jugaloo. Let DC residents decide statehood and representatives for themselves. They could have a guardsmen then. No white guy gets 60yrs in your state for AR. Taxation without representation. Did you go to Kevin's 100k dinner? Did  treasonous trio go Balloony?
Political theatrics from insurrection Timmy.
Nothing on inflation yet?  Make DC a state and give those residents and taxpayers a meaningful voice in Congress then maybe they’ll give a damn about what you think they ought to do.
More walk and talk whining, crying, and lying from our useless Tn GOP.
You are whining about political propaganda that you think would benefit yourself…. Big big waste of tax dollars!
Here we are again. Out in the parking lot walking around instead of working.
Can we try that again with improved syntax?
Hey Burchett Tennessee is third in the country for violent crimes so what is your plan?
Hey Timmy how is inflation going? Gas prices? What are you doing for the Tennessee constituents to make their daily lives easier?
Xenophobic, racist coward
Doesn’t the US have surveillance programs the unconstitutionally spies on the American public?Why go after China alone, you should be going after our own intel. agencies
 All my double 1st cousins of my daddy's brother except for one of them. They held me down and done just about everything to me except have sex/rap me. It was family and I was young but I was told I can't tell anyone. Let someone touch my 2 granddaughters. I'm quite.
Why isn’t Ellerbasch indicted in Knoxville?
60 years for armed burglary in DC? It’s 6-30 yrs max in TN. And it’s burglary, not “burgsly”. #Statehood4DC  #BananaRepublicans
No problem there.
birdschitt hasn't mentioned inflation one time since the mid terms. hope everyone is paying attention to how little he does for the voters in the 2nd district
Thnx for the update. With respect, is there any valid reason that the information acquired from analyzing the leftovers of the Chinese balloon payload should be classified?
If I hired a character actor and said, “Act like a self-important tool,” if the guy was any good he’d do it just like this.
DC is under the total jurisdiction of the US Congress. The little power granted to the mayor, council, &amp; non-voting representative are not enough. Illegal Immigration Reform &amp; Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was passed, barring noncitizens from voting in fed. elections.
#12MillionBidenJobs
Who is this guy??? Did somebody kidnap Burchett and replaced him with this guy???
No way in "hades," this place should be a state (D. C.)!"
All talk. All blame.  NO action. NO class.
It's just not D.C., there are sixteen municipalities across the country that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.  And the balloon thing, it's happened before.
Excuse me, Tim, but wouldn't decreasing violent crimes be a good thing?  And people who have lived in America for decades should not be called "foreigners." Tell whichever staff member who sends your tweets to do better.
So are all UAP going to be called spy balloons now?
Sen. Rick Scott says "no," it wasn’t a mistake to propose a plan that would require all legislation, including that relating to programs like Social Security and Medicare, to sunset unless Congress reauthorizes them. Our full interview this morning:
Great work Tim.
Where was your loud MOUTH when those 3 Chinese balloons flew over during your God’s “tenure?” You’re such a GD hypocrite!
“We forced them “uhhh they forced them,” stutter, stutter, freudian slip there good buddy, lmao!  Boebert rubbing off on you?
Honest question and please answer: Should an immigrant, who is currently living in this country legally and with proper documentation, and pays federal taxes, be allowed to vote (even if they are not a US citizen)?
Why do Tennessee Republicans complain about violent crimes in other places when violent crimes in Tennessee are far higher per capita?  Republican policies have failed Tennessee.
How the hell did you get to be a congressman?
 I have never seen crap like this President and vice president along with the democrats!! Why don't he keep help all the other countries, bring in All the illegal immigrants just so they can vote for Biden. We are a Living the book of revelations right now !!
Greaseball twit.  Shave your face, you look homeless and we know how much Republicans hate the homeless.
Performative politics rather than working to help your constituents- still one of the least educated states and one of the poorest. Good thing you keep ‘em dumb &amp; poor or you’d be out of a job.
The real question is, where was our BALLOON to BLOCK a bumper sticker airship?  #USA  Representative Burchett American pride  Mr. President,  No one cares, obviously 
I seriously just tweeted that illegals are ALLOWED to vote in the election. My Dad was in the military and if he were alive, he'd be ashamed that his son is a shell of a human.
Allowing foreigners to vote? Are you crazy? Oh wait.
I guess going home another week of nothing. You owe us money. You can't even work a 40-hour week. Make more than people who really work. Complaining about Twitter complaining about Washington DC and doing something Biden was going to do in May. What a of taxpayers money
Just learned on NewsMax that sleazy Joe inability to make decision to shoot down China spy balloon 🎈 before traverse of USA, learned intelligence was unable to block information gathered by China from balloon 🎈.  REMOVE SLEAZY JOE NOW😡🤬
I’d bet China gleaned plenty of new intelligence from the multiple spy balloons that WEREN’T shot down while Trump was president.
During tense House briefing, Biden administration officials defend US response to balloon and say Chinese gleaned little new intelligence. Sources say that the U.S. officials argued that more info was gained by US intelligence from the shot-down balloon

Sure, we’ll return it.  Right after they return the $7 TRILLION they forced us to spend after unleashing COVID across the world.
Exactly Nick! Now let’s just say if the United States sent over a secret surveillance balloon over China, and spotted it they would of shot it down they wouldn’t give our balloon back, so I find their response quite hilarious. But we could make a fake decoy and send it back
YBM Jimi - “Perc 30” 
Yeah right ! We will just box it up and ship it to you…let us know when it gets there.
They will own none of it and they will be happy
Biden would probably do it
General Mark Milley will give something to that Chinese diplomat alright. Mark my words.
I would send China a pack of balloons from a dollar store and tell them "that's all we found".
China is now demanding the United States return the debris from their spy balloon.  What would you say to China if you were president?
And make sure those balloons were made in China.
That’s awesome!
I can buy a balloon from toy shop for China. What color does China
Red white and blue
If you would’ve been included in the sub committee hearing about the China balloon, you would’ve heard conclusively why the military tracked it, blocked it from doing anything, and then shot it down over water to prevent collateral damage to Americans, and to give us a better…
Is that the new release from China? Is that what the balloons  were about?
NEW - WHO's Tedros says we "must prepare" for a potential H5N1 human bird flu pandemic.
First the signal from the balloon was scrambled so China couldn’t spy on us /Second Biden has done more for the American people than any President in the last 25 years and please go back and get an education it really does help in understanding how a Government works / https://t.co/0QCt3edbLA
China spied and Biden LIED.  The Liar in Chief came to The People’s House and lied about the economy, the border, and was too weak &amp; afraid to apologize to America for his failure to protect us from China.  No golf claps from me.   Last night I proudly represented the people.
the mainstream media is so unserious like let me get this straight, a flying balloon from China is a violation of us sovereignty but not pelosis undiplomatic visit to Taiwan last year even though it is a violation of the one China policy?
And coincidentally, this threatening ballon incident happened just before the visit of the Secretary of State to Beijing to deescalate tensions, talks that are now canceled and instead the new speaker will be going to Taiwan which is extremely reckless. Connect the dotes here
In a sharp contrast to the massive amount of discussions on China Balloon on US press &amp; social media, public mentions of it &amp; all unanswered questions on China side only appear to be loose jokes by netizens, incomplete cites from foreign media &amp; rigid official narratives.
Thanks to increased UAP (UFO) monitoring, the ccp balloons should now be easier to spot. Ironically the UAP could also be something that ultimately forces the world to unite.
China will become embarrassed in the world when it is revealed about the capabilities of the equipment. China will be the World's Nosiest Country.
Balloon over Superbowl?
is that what Chinese do when they lose face?

I hope it’s just a coincidence. I was beginning to think it was related to the big balloon from China.
China is launching balloons around the world. what is their purpose? China collects information from all over the world.
Spy balloon from china.  Outages today. I’m sure just coincidence. Go Super Bowl team! https://t.co/KUcfD501ax
just like the US attack on China, although you did nothing, you will be rumored to be violating them is the same, although they have also flown into weather balloons in other countries before. Just to keep you from getting stronger and better
Just because you are low-key, kind, and don't like to trouble others, they keep using the same unfounded rumors to smear you
When will ESPN address the NBA getting TEN Billion from CHINA? CHINA flies spy balloons over USA as NBA sucks in big bucks from CCP. Be a reporter and call them out for supporting the slave state CHINA. https://t.co/IK2mcxNoxD
When the Us sees the surveillance balloon from China https://t.co/McCVAd3XRD
From George Santos lies,  to infantile MBS/Boebert/Gaetz,  to China balloon hysteria,  to John Hoeven election-denial, …  today’s GOP is a “tear it all down” treason cult.
As I discussed with and President Biden’s remarks re: oil at the SOTU drew a big push back from the crowd because it’s his own admin that’s placed handcuffs on U.S. energy producers &amp; is driving up prices for consumers.
WASHINGTON (AP) — China balloon shot down by the US was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals as part of a huge military-linked aerial surveillance program that targeted more than 40 countries the Biden admin said Thursday citing imagery from American U-2 spy planes
Well i told you I saw something over the Joint Center For Lethality over in them there hills.
China now WANTS their balloon back.. 🤣🤣  THOUGHTS?
Was it actually a Chinese spy ballon? It was is some sort of cover-up? #flatearth #Conspiracy #NASA #rumble https://t.co/FLEKKRUwO0
Given the winds travel west to east (or the Earth spins east to west), China will need to launch their balloons from Africa to reach Australia.
The Mozambicans can do China a favour there.
Don’t tell the Aussies. They’ll run to uncle USA and spill the beans..
You expect these people to understand the earth is round? And it spins? Lol
We are supposed to believe these balloons are “maneuverable”, which of course means that they can fly anywhere at anytime in any weather. Balloons maneuver much better than any other aircraft after all. The next gen of fighter aircraft will certainly have a balloon shape.
Maybe call the African program  belt and road and balloon?
First line of attack from China is weather balloons?
BREAKING: The White House confirms another flying object was shot down off the coast of Alaska about an hour ago.

#MarjorieTraitorGreene, noted attention-seeker and inciter of insurrections, literally cursed out Defense officials believing she knew better regarding the spy balloon.  The measured response from Defense was to keep Americans safe. MTG is the real threat. https://t.co/yIMr3sqLFc
Please remind Americans that MTG does NOT hold extreme Republican views, she holds what are now mainstream Republican views in an extremist political party.

Loose cannon
What a hateful and despicable human she is.
Her God Trump said the same thing He knew better then the Generals., only him could stop the Taliban instead he invited them to Canp David for a vacation.
Exactly
MTG, just another Georgia point of pride

Though news has to be reported, please consider not using her image. Not that it's offensive. Rather, it's what promotes her, and what people will remember; not your words.
She never gets reprimanded for what she does(heckling during State of the Union, bringing a balloon to Congress, etc.). McCarthy let’s her get away with everything. It only makes him look weak because he can’t control her and others.
And her ilk!

Was talking to a group of old time republicans.  All voted Trump in 2016. 2/3 Trump in 2020.  None would vote Trump or Trump style Republican in 2024.  There is hope for for a moderate level headed Republican in 2024.  MTG, Gaetz, Bobo thumbs down
Grandiose. Probably should be arrested for disturbing the peace or disorderly conduct.
you had to wait second to last? You mean there was someone less worthy than you? Damn, why don’t you get the gazpacho onto this. It’s an outrage 
You are right is there any chance of the Military shooting her down, lol
#GQPClownShow the GQP House members are unbelievable starting from the spineless top down. 
This rabid animal needs a muzzle 
Talking potato head goes Karen on them..
Based on the gait of the DC bomber and based on her ignorant yet forward leaning attitude it is a safe bet that she is the DC Bomber. She is a national security threat and I hope the FBI has her under surveillance.
She’s the Dunning-Kruger effect incarnate. Cringeworthy.
Chinese and Russian spies.
This is the real mastermind behind US Defenses. The POTUS and Pentathieves will do ANYTHING if she calls them Chicken. Bawk! Bawk!   How Appropriate.  Her kind and the Military deserve each other, but they should pay their own bills.
Get rid of this buffoon !!
"Greene, whose office said her&nbsp;outfit at the State of the Union&nbsp;was meant to echo the Chinese spy balloon..."  Too bad this gassy menace keeps violating our national airspace.
She’s such an ignoramus.   Oh Republicans… what a weak, compromised cesspool you have become.   Yes, you stink and you are toxic to our nation.   #RepublicanClownShow
Who gives a fk what she believes?  Eventually she's going to mouth off to the wrong one and get put in her place.
Traitor Greene really is white trash.
lol, she says her weird white fur outfit was supposed to remind people of the balloon.  nice going, people who voted for her.  this is what you had in mind, right?   ignorant bashing of the military?
She belongs in QAnon forums and group chat not in the chambers. Shameful politician
MTG only cares about one thing. Herself.
“The literate mind has sown the seeds of its own destruction through the creation of media that render irrelevant those “traditional skills" on which literacy rests.”  Neal Postman  And behavior. And civil discourse rendered by trusted elected officials.
"Sounded like bullshit," she said.  And if it *sounds like* bullshit to it must be bullshit, right?  Because she is known for her impeccable judgment.

If it had been brought down over land the GOP would be screaming about how stupidly risky it was to crash a potential WMD

Better get all the craziness out of your system lady. Your party will once again be back in the minority were it belongs, soon. No matter what our political beliefs are, we should at least expect members of Congress to act like grownups.
House insurrectionists named MTG "Speaker Pro Tempore", so i THINK that means "she's 3rd in line", provided MAGA "manage" the necessary circumstances (accidents, on purpose). #ArrestTrumpNow #ArrestSpyMTG
The spy balloon should not have even crossed into our airspace  She right you're wrong get over it.
Howler Monkeys at work!
MAGA is a Homegrown Radicalized Domestic Terrorist Organization.  Every White Supremacist, Militia Group and Conspiracy Theorist in America belongs to it.  The QGOP never condemns them.  The QGOP and The Fox Propaganda Network gaslight them daily to fuel their anger.
Pardon my French, but…
MTG is a fecking imbecile.
We all know she is dangerous as well as extremely stupid. Keep watching her and keep her reigned in!!
She is increasingly dangerous and illiterate.

This buffoon knows next to nothing about everything. She's a laughingstock.
all your attention seeking antics only confirm how ignorant your are about EVERYTHING you tweet.  You’ve been in Congress for more than 2 years and have not authored or contributed ONE piece of legitimate legislation.  #Lickspittle
you really are stupid and Ignorant. Doubting our military. I’m sure they were taken all kinds of pictures and checking out that balloon to make sure all is well before they shot it down.
Greene, Boebert, Sanyo’s are loose cannons but also stupid. It’s only a matter of time before their hot heads and big mouths start screaming national secrets! They are a danger to national security!
Many people don't realize this but mtg is a godsend. Everybody will get to witness just how stupid she is.
certainly seems to be lacking some brain cells. DO YOU THINK?!
She is a total lunatic!
MTG VOTED JUST ONE OF THE 'REAL-SCREW-BALLS OF THE WORLD' BY A LOT OF PEOPLE OF THE WORLD!
Why is she in our government? What is wrong with the voters. They're ignorant.
I back forecasted the latest "Balloon" shoot down in AK. Based on the location and time, it tracks back to near the Kotzebue NWS Rawinsonde site. Did we shoot down an NWS Weather balloon?? There is no data for the 12Z launch from that site and all the rest worked. #Chinaballoon https://t.co/20N0bAwugd
If not, then it goes back to the Bering Sea and then to NE Russia.
Also possible they did not launch a balloon at Kotzebue this morning at 12Z.
Dan, remarkable work. What might the NWS be able to add?
Hi Peter, I would like to know if the NOME Balloon had issues and or if one was launched from Kotzebue today that failed. If so, then I think we may have the answer.
Could be that station is not used now. NOME is not that far away. Data is in for Nome.
Nome sounding stopped at 100 mb today. It could be the NOME rawinsonde balloon had issues.
Could be the NOME Balloon if it failed and data stops at 100 mb at NOME on the 12z launch. It could have not gone up and burst as it should.
If it failed and was drifting down into commercial air lanes, we probably needed to do something. The NOAA Rawinsonde balloons are designed to burst and then fall by a small parachute back to earth. They are ofen found and reconditioned.
Pentagon says they are confident that the object did not belong to the USA Govt.  That would rule out a NOAA rawinsonde balloon. Suspect they will need to recover to know for sure. Nome launches their balloon at 12 and 00Z. That is 3 AM and 3 PM local time in Nome.
All AK upper air sites are auto launcher sites for upper air. It could be an equipment issue or someone in Kotzebue forgot to restock the sondes and balloons. You might reach out to the NWS Fairbanks office for more information.
I was wondering if they were auto-launch sites. Even the PANC site?

So now, it's ok to shoot down an object over Alaska. What was the excuse for why they could not do this the first time? #ChinaBalloon #bideniscompromised #compromised #incompetent #murkowski
"China Spy Balloon" is deflection from being exposed blowing up Russia's $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  the Pentagon picked up the balloon over Alaska and let it fly across the entire country intentionally. https://t.co/ZjXVCzGRNS
And from the release of the 9/11 terrorist
419 pairs of eyes are blinded by the insane anti-China ideology.
Make a lot of sense.
A distraction to deter us from focusing on how bad he handled the China Balloon!
Wow! The US has taken down another spy flight “object” over Alaska which landed in our territorial waters but the water is frozen. Per Kirby, the Resident ordered it taken down.
yeah there probably wasn't even a balloon. just a pr story to make his previous screw up less bad. which it doesn't.
Expect more Chinese Spy Balloons in Oz, after this measure is completed. :)
From China Spy Balloon 🎈to China Balloon Capable of Spying...
Why? Because It Has An Antenna.
Capable of spying...unlike the US, actually spying 24/7.
So, investigators with the China balloon recovery, have found out from markings in American language from debris, tells them the Chinese have a program flying over 5 continents and 40 countries. American writing just tells them that.....  SNOW JOB BULLSHIT! PREPARE TAIWAN! 🤦‍♂️

There is no data for the 12Z launch from that site and all the rest worked. #Chinaballoon https://t.co/20N0bAwugd
Nah, I am not sure what it is. If not a NOAA balloon that had issues, then it tracks back to Russia and not China. Seems to be a mystery. Maybe someone did it as a joke. Now, if we find the charred remains of Owly Skywarn... ;)
Owly Skywarn better be ok.  I know they have clones of Owly, but it’s just not the same.   And sometimes those mascot clones go berserk. #RIPMrZip
So you've got no idea what a weather balloon looks like
Could be that station is not used now. NOME is not that far away. Data is in for Nome.
Nome sounding stopped at 100 mb today. It could be the NOME rawinsonde balloon had issues.

Yes, both WFO sites in AK region have auto sonde launchers.
Oops :-)
~ maybe it’s falling from an array further up ? ~ one of Elon’s ?  Is the Tesla still tacked on … . 
Yep. We shot down an NWS balloon. #NothingBurger
Who benefits from spending that much money to shoot down a weather balloon and tell the American people about it? Why would you have data of such a launch?
...The Department of Defense?
They are sending money to china to fund the vaxx and protect Biden. Any other thoughts?
If you think those are bad things, then I should have blocked you already.
Or...
Some say these balloons have the ability to regulate their altitude. Not sure if that’s true or how much uncertainty that adds to your model.
Dan the object as described does not sound like a weather balloon or any kind of balloon...
Is that balloon also the size of a small car though?
That would be hilary-ious.
I am sure they do but if it had issues it might be only half inflated and if in commercial air altitudes, it was a danger.
NWS weather balloons do not pose any threat to aviation, and would not even if one were to go neutrally buoyant in the troposphere. More than 180 weather balloons are sent up each day by US agencies alone, or almost 70,000 per year. No accidents have ever resulted.
What about this?
Comments?
~ the pentagon said size of a car , specifically NOT a balloon ~ origin unknown ~ 
Just a practice shot!
I hate when data makes the story factually correct…
No balloon is safe now. Lol
sooooooo.funny............
Bad aim again.
"back forcasted" = retrodiction.   You're welcome.
Standard go to UFO story, weather balloon
As a balloon launcher for ECCC's PASPC, I don't think the object was a weather balloon. Regular weather balloons aren't designed to stay at an altitude for a long period of time. It normally takes about 40-50 minutes for a balloon to complete an ascent before popping.
that would have had markings on it, right?
Some kids in Khazakstan are  wondering what happened to their birthday balloons not realizing they started an international incident
I suspect the Whitehouse has put a lid on the UFO shot down over the north slope story out of embarrassment. The pilots would have photographed it, known if it was floating or flying, known its shape, color and anything dangling below it and spoke to controllers (more)
to give the details to request weapons hot permission. They are withholding information for a reason. Either National security, or Embarrassment. Embarrassment seems more likely. I think they shot down a scientists balloon used to study climate change including
sea ice thickness and extents or polar bear census. I think it was launched from the climate research group in Barrow or Uqtiagvik I think they call it now. Clown show is my most generous thought at the moment.
Interesting
We are getting really aggressive at tracking Santa…
… dunno this source but interesting
 might have been some jamming or interference on getting the data from the wx balloon. Uhf is pretty easy to jam and the military even said that “object” was impacting their own sensors/instruments so not out of the realm of possibilities
Allegedly, the object shot down over AK looked like a cylinder, gray or silver in color (?), about the size of a small car.  Is that NWS weather balloons look like?
One would think the US military would be able to ask around in the Govt if anyone could identify the object, before they decided to shoot it down. In your opinion, are they the types to shoot first and ask questions later?
This is all being done to cover up the actual ufos...2023 version of Roswell  ...a week ago the news was a flutter ..nothing  is a coincidence
Lmao at the US shooting down our own balloons to distract people from Mayo Pete's Ohio Bhopal
I have a feeling that is being personally manned by the C-in-C himself
It wouldn't surprise me our balloon paranoia will get the better of some innocent balloons.
We all know that Joe Biden has been in a supine position when it comes to communist China. We also know that he is overcompensating now when it comes to shooting down every object in the sky.
Can you read?  The description does not fit a NWS balloon.
China went from primitive spy balloons to space lasers within a week 😐

Nah, it's nothing new and is even expressly allowed by international law.
Don't get the vapors or anything, but they have spy satellites over us as we sit here. We fly U-2s over them. Militarily, this is a zero. I am much more concerned about their extensive infiltration of academia and industrial spying. This may be part of that.
So now, it's ok to shoot down an object over Alaska. What was the excuse for why they could not do this the first time? #ChinaBalloon #bideniscompromised #compromised #incompetent #murkowski
Right
They never intended to shoot it down. It wasn't until there was so much criticism, they had to do it.
Maybe it couldn't wait. It may not have been a balloon at 40k feet?
The Biden administration got called out by the American people. Now they have to display strength against the CCP even though many of us know Biden is compromised and surrounded by people more interested in business deals with China than America's security and Americans' safety.
"China Spy Balloon" is deflection from being exposed blowing up Russia's $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  the Pentagon picked up the balloon over Alaska and let it fly across the entire country intentionally. https://t.co/ZjXVCzGRNS
And from the release of the 9/11 terrorist
419 pairs of eyes are blinded by the insane anti-China ideology.
Make a lot of sense.
Expect more Chinese Spy Balloons in Oz, after this measure is completed. :)
Where will stupidity end? Thousands of surveillance cameras in OZ are Chinese-made. OZ DoD will strip buildings of Chinese security cameras. Follows lead of US &amp; UK. Fear that Chinese companies could be forced to share intelligence with security services.
And this is Meiping - she is crucial for our spy balloons.  What are you holding, Meiping? These are the steering strings, Sir. Really? How do they work? When I pull the right string, the balloon heads South ... the left one sends it North ... Have you never flown a kite, Sir.?
China learnt alot from US  Still mastering   Project Genetrix
Do you have any ideas how the winds blow in Southern Hemisphere? Don’t look like an idiot!
From China Spy Balloon 🎈to China Balloon Capable of Spying...
So, investigators with the China balloon recovery, have found out from markings in American language from debris, tells them the Chinese have a program flying over 5 continents and 40 countries. American writing just tells them that.....  SNOW JOB BULLSHIT! PREPARE TAIWAN! 🤦‍♂️
China released the footage captured from the balloons https://t.co/QaEMVsMAMg
Another One Bites The Dust.
Thank you I needed that
Why would china release the footage if We captured them?  You may want to reword that
😂😂  China commits to using more friendly spy balloons from now on https://t.co/GinwF2hsAh
Well I guess it's the least they can do to improve morale!
 &lt;lift&gt;     PMSL
I do hope they use this big purple and yellow one pictured in the Shovel post...
He he
 looks like a purple people eater..wtaf !
Probably to scare kids and animals...
Haha these balloons   would give any child or animal or me (who is NOT adulting currently!) a phobia for life !!
China is shining green lasers down to Earth from space from their satellites, this was near Hawaii  This doesn’t seem good https://t.co/Xs1gOihAHu
Might scanning into the ground. China n United States work in tandem on these projects. Some are connected to Musk. No lie. Remember the earth's core just reversed. So look up this info n try to connect this plz n let me know
core didn't reverse - when that happens your compass will flip. also you'll be dead
Poles have reversed many times over the history of the Earth - I’ve always wondered how each time everything wasn’t obliterated on the surface.. kind of makes you doubt the idea of a molten, spinning core.. unless there’s a different source of the magnetic field
yeah - somehow life persists.  cataclysm seems to hit most of the earth (not all of it)  and/or people figure out shelters that are powerful enough to resist (the pyramids? underground networks?)
Nothing would survive that sort of inertial stop, the tidal waves would sweep everything off the surface. Also - where would the energy to restart the spin come from? It’s all very strange..
we’ll see!
Chinese space lasers
lol!! Yes
maybe they’re working on the Super Bowl halftime show
CCP = Cosmic Chinese Parties
ChiNazis suck.  It is not good to praise them.
its a joke now calm down nothing wrong with the  Chinese but the goverment is fucked
1930's/1940's  "nothing wrong with the Germans but the government is fucked"  "ChiNazi" is a valid term. It's just a different "flavor" of the same poison.  Some day there will be no more Nazis, Chi- or otherwise.  (hopefully still lots of Germans and Chinese :-) )
I fully support trying to take their leadership out.  Biggest threat to mankind.
Yes it is.  Option B is they slowly infiltrate us and take us over by bedding our politicians financially.
Ill politicians are already all fully in bed financially with American corporations and lobbying firms.. they’re bought, every one of them
What was the music like?
Drifting away gotta be playing there surely
They’re just remaking the “rock with you” video
They think it's the Aerosol and Carbon dioxide Detection Lidar instrument on the Chinese Daqi-1/AEMS satellite, used to measure atmospheric pollution.
So China is one if the biggest polluters in the world, why would they collect pollution data???
Read your tweet again
Right!?!?!?
Speculative ass reporting lmao
more like "reporting"
You are suppose to focus on Russia. The government will tell you who your enemy is.
And what vaccine to get, and what gender we are, and what car to buy, and what we can say in a public forum…
It just keeps going.
Is this for real? How do we know its china? Seriously concerning!
Do y’all realize the earthquake in Turkey during the Grammy ritual invoking Satan inside the protection circle . Y’all need to do a little research on satanic spells and rituals because that’s the principalities we will battle.
No but good call on that 
Not trying to be a dick but Turkey isn’t near the ring of fire, from what I know, which may be nothing. Why do you mention it? Curious
No dude I deserve it I’m clearly handicapped because I could have sworn it covered the Adriatic region completely and it clearly doesn’t  I guess they seat on the Albide belt which is the second most active region…. Sheee well I’m glad I got that right finally.
Targeting systems
Not 100% sure I believe this one.   The beam would be more diffused and would be traveling waaaaaay faster
Yeah was thinking that on the diffusion part unless there's some sort of super laser that doesn't diffuse even from those great heights.  Can't believe anything these days (if you ever could)
Yeah....to stay THAT focused from space would be a feat
If the beam originated in space,  it would pass through 30ish miles of atmosphere to reach the ground
If it were passing through the vacuum of space,  we wouldn't see it at all. We only see the beam when it hits something (dust, water vapor, etc)
It exists,  but we don't see it until it reacts with something.
Can we just take  off the gloves and get this over with?  Whatever will be will be.
No one wins in that fight, just millions gone on both sides.
Billions.
Then tool up bcz shit is gettin spooky
I'm a crack shot with extensive training, have dogs that will protect the house, have martial arts training, work out 6 days a week, and can't even take down a "weather balloon". War isn't like the movies, it's just sad. There's no glory in watching your loved ones fall.
The matrix
China? How do you know this? Shame on assumptions.
They’re trying to catch cats
Targeting lasers. No big deal.
do the best light show in history
PowerPoint presentation from space. No big deal.  It’s definitely not identifying or pointing to anything specific… or a weapon with a green dot laser.. cringe.
Can we shine ours back t them?
It's obviously not a satellite. The arc of the laser beam is too wide to have originated from space.  It's either a CGI or a drone at low altitude.
Also there's no satellite ever made that can support that kind of power draw/usage.
well green always means go in my book so what ever operative was to see it they got the ok!! Or ballon white could symbolize death  green laser could mean as trickster or more unfaithfulness /// going to die??
China be ramping up
How do y’all know this as fact? This sounds like a tweet to put fear into people that we’re gonna be attacked. “This doesn’t seem good”
So nothing to worry about then??
Explains why the cats in Hawaii were acting weird!
#ChinaSpyBalloon looks like a grid being surveyed with mapping software?
My thoughts as well
And our government sit on their hands and do nothing about it
RACIST!!!!!!
Satellites, AI, CGI will deceive the entire world. Let’s not fall for it
Why can’t they just worry about themselves and their country? Leave the rest of us alone!
They are a rising power. USA is a falling power. There's usually a time on the graph where those 2 points will meet. There's usually war when that happens
Biden still owes them money.
Same as it ever was.
 possible range detection or scanning?
That’s what I would guess, or terrain mapping
might not be far off base about space lasers….. just saying.
This should be easy to calculate the altitude of the source with the varying angles of each pulse.
These lasers have clear weather application. Nothing to worry about. As long as they don’t do this in populated areas this actually has a lot of positive effects from the data gathered. The way the lasers detect molecules is fascinating. Basically spectroscopy.
Its an act of war by a foreign entity.. you're a treasonist..
They did it on the east coast, too.
I’m sure we have some immensely powerful lasers. We need to shoot back. What the CCP is doing with satellites and balloons is aggressive and should be stopped.
They look Jewish.
I seen this clip but it said it was the other way around that it was our military scanning the air for balloons
looks like local car dealer parking lot.
From a buddy of mine who's stationed at Hickam AFB. No briefs, warnings, or drills are happening.  Unsure what this is but the USAF doesn't seem to be concerned by it
measuring stuff
a couple of our NOAA satellites do that, too. Some for geology and other various things.
Reflect it back?
How dare the Chinese steal the jewish space laser technology. This is war.
Independence Day vibes…
Definitely not LiDAR or anything.
"air pollution"........... right.
Yep. It is right. It’s not important that you believe it because you’re some conspiracy theorist, not a scientist
Seems like they’re getting ready to do something 
the lights came from a remote-sensing laser (an altimeter called ATLAS) from the satellite ICESat-2/43613  Read more at:
They're not - the team that operates ICESat-2 did some simulations of satellite tracks and determined the most likely source was the the Chinese Daqi-1/AEMS satellite.
No satellite has EVER been even close to outputting that kind of power, but I mean.. Sure.
Proof ?
They’re just trying to freak people out. Don’t fall for it.
Those couldn’t be… space lasers? I seem to remember a lot of mockery about those on like, Monday.
They might use it to keep their drones flying indefinitely.
I am just happy Americans have woken up and they can see what the politicians don't want them to see
Be responsible. Read the article and stop spreading fear. “China's Daqi-1 satellite was launched in April last year and similar to ICESat-2, it's an atmospheric environment monitoring satellite.”
“Be responsible” spoken like a true fascist. DoNt QuEsTioN ANyThiNg!
MTG and her "space lasers" don't seem so crazy now, do they?
Give it a month and the bolts will rattle apart and their satellite.
I’m sure it’s fine!
A buddy said they where silently planning for a future invasion … Allegedly
Then again it could be one of ours
Where did they question anything? Also this happened two weeks ago.
Maybe it’s god getting ready for the rapture
China? Making a guess here, someone is using green lasers to measure atmospheric conditions (humidity, wind speed &amp; direction, temperature) at various altitudes.
They're testing something ...
Crazy.
I thought they needed a balloon to spy on the US.
When you have a president that can only remember he likes ice cream, the US seems weak.
Ha, wait to you two hear of the atrocities caused by America..
So, in actual fact, the 'balloon' was a giant disco ball.  China was just throwing the USA a party. Easy to misunderstand.
Lidar scans for mapping. Not sure why over Hawaii unless they are mapping their new land.
lol no way
How do we know it is china?
It's a scanner, china just scanned Hawaii's barcode and bought it.
Americans are outsmarted these days.
It looks like the start to a EDC set. I’m waiting for the bass to drop.
They're probably just checking to see who all has the Disney channel. Nothing nefarious could happen with lasers.
testing range no doubt
Yeah, that looks real safe.
Are you sure is China at this point?
Maybe Chinese version of chatgp-Ai went rogue took over a satellite and decided to doodle.
Aren't these the famous Jewish lasers?
Wonder if it had anything to do with all the atmospheric rivers…
I mean, they were doing a lot of serious weather manipulation for the Beijing Olympics…
We are screwed, mine as well enjoy the weekend since biden screwed us on the market too, he places a 40% tax on the stock market. So we wager our money to lose half of it , yeah makes sense
no no no green lasers are GOOD GOOD GOOD... now if they used red lasers, white lasers, or blue lasers then that would be bad bad bad.
They do this for ships they’re scanning the terrain to get a 3-D mapping
How do we know what this is?
Might just be from LiDAR scans  I don’t know the science behind LiDAR, but I do know they use lasers to map the earths typography
Jewish space lasers made in China?
I know you guys have to sensationalize to get engagement and all, but this on the surface is a non-issue. Our own weather satellites do this, and the satellite that did it was originally misidentified as one of our own.
It's Alien lasers!
100% Dance Dance Revolution
I’m sure it’s just some more weather data… 
Uhmmm WTF??!
WTAF IS GOING ON?!?!
Not green - distorted by IR camera.  Many satellites have light-based ground sensors.
It's not a weapon.  It's a way to estimate air pollutants.  It's from a joint US-China project.
Congratulations, This is the most retweets tweet of 2023-02-11.
Let the cgi WW3 terror begin 
Project bluebeam
I love this new “Readers added context” thing. It’s easy now to see which accounts are talking out of their ass, like this one. Good feature
we see u hodgebois sticking to script
Seen briefly in the UK tonight, never seen before but now popping up everywhere. Are they scanning the seas with lidar to find nuclear submarines? 
was talking about space lasers. She was on to something.
This President is likely going to start WWIII.
Probably a great way to calculate air density and speed for dropping a warhead from space.
That's from a NASA satellite, no big deal.
You do realize that China owns 5 Trillion in US Stock and could and probably will collapse our system with a sell off.
Keith and Kev, I used to really look up to you guys man. I was around for the early YouTube days. I didn’t mind the switch to political content but you guys have devolved into just another fear-mongering platform for clicks. Spreading ACTUAL misinformation is wrong.
Could be explained as “Sprites”, a documented atmospheric light phenomenon. However, they are usually shooting up, move mostly vertical and much higher in the atmosphere. I am no expert but have seen many videos and pics, they don’t match. 
We should be looking to the Holy Books
Their military has been preparing for war, while ours is trying to figure out which bathroom to use.
It's been a Good Run...I sure hope the U.S.A. has a secret program producing Combat Robots. Soy Boy will have to control them remotely...
My gut feeling is never have we been so unsafe and my lifetime includes the Cuban Missile crisis.
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot
Who knows, if we go to war with China, maybe we can ask Ukraine to float us a loan of about $100 billion.
Wait…what? Have you seen wtf we’ve done any Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia, etc etc etc…and now Ukraine…???  Now, tell me again…what “doesn’t seem
If we survive this Biden term it will be a miracle. 
$NEO marketing.
More China or SpaceX? This was 10 mins ago
This is the closest thing to something we saw in the sky about 2 years ago. What we saw was a much less intense light, but it was a straight line that rotated kind of like a straw laying in water I’ve never been able to come close to making sense of it.
Explosions in Billings, MT? About  3 weeks ago, same thing happened in N Idaho, north of Hayden, ID, north of I-90.   Explosion, earthquake-like, bright light in night sky.  No explanation, no answers. NW forest fires? Food production facilities burned? Could it be, enemy balloon
Pearl harbour 2.0 is just over the horizon and America is trying to have a period without a uterus...
Throwback -- This was China in total lockdown: tens of thousands drones flying in the sky and shouting:  ''Stay at home and control your soul's desire for freedom, or you will bear legal liability...''
We had 5 military helicopters fly over our house in North Texas a few hours ago…
So we see a green laser coming from space and assume it’s China. Wow, the Intel on this is amazing. i’ve personally never been able to tell the country of origin from looking at a laser. Unless it was fired from that country. grow up people. it’s embarrassing!!
Just a little light show for the masses.
NASA as well as japans satellites (ICESat-2) have been doing the same thing, measuring the same atmospheric data, specifically pollution. China's Daqi-1 satellite was launched in April last year and similar to ICESat-2, it's an atmospheric environment monitoring satellite.
For a laser to do any damage from the distance of a low earth orbit, it would need to be housed in something bigger than the ISS. Would be easily spottable with the naked eye and shot down just as easy. I'm calling this a nothing burger.
I believe its our own government before I believe its China. Any confirmed source?
When USA poke in Taiwan That's good but  China poke in Hawai that's not good. In  July 7, 1898 — the Hawaiian islands were officially annexed by the United States is good. Where ever you are, everything in favor is good.... We need more good.... Thats our level of moral standard
you do know that earth-based telescopes use lasers to help focus out the affects our atmosphere has on the optics and gives us much clearer in focus images. and Hawaii has some of the largest ground-based telescopes on the planet
Testing project bluebeam in 1 2 3
I see the word "likely" being used liberally by the "experts" in the Science Alert article. In other words nobody really knows the answer or they don't want to reveal the real answer.
Can they wait til after the superbowl
It's all part of their ICBS missile  to lead it to its target precisely. they  now have the exact coordinates for our electrical grids and nuclear silo locations from their spy balloon. Were sitting ducks
The hammer of dawn
Think those ballons could be making a roadmap for the satellite lasers?
Ew super creepy.
Nah, nothing can possibly go wrong, right guys?
LIDAR from space?
Possible these were the icbms coming back in from our test.
GF(Net) purpose for positive public
Maybe is not china, the US do a lot of weird stuff and blames everyone else, or they are together on this  just saying
Could be LiDAR scan
How do you know it’s China?
It's all a work.. If it's been on the news, it's a farce and no one should fall for it. US and China are the same as the good guy wrestler and the bad guy wrestler. When the crowd is watching, they hate each other but will kick it later at the bar as buddies.
Moonraker.
Perfectly fine
it's aliens
Not good at all!!!
Bet ya it’s those HI TECH surveillance BALLOONS   POPs ping-ping KNOWS the MC Hammer tune &amp; tells the US “U can’t touch this”!!!!!!! LOL
Must be jewish space lasers
This is probably more begin than you think. Lasers like this are used in atmospheric disturbance analysis, they're probably using it to calibrate their optics, compensating for deflection in the atmosphere. Its not good the Chinese have good spy satellites, but its not strange.
Prove it that it’s China. Maybe it’s USA
The DeathStar DOES exist. 
Their lazing the targets.
Hate to burst the bubble here but satellites are an elaborate hoax. It's a fear tactic. There are of course high altitude planes &amp; balloons. Which btw China just fully exposed the satellite lies due to the fact a balloon just floated over our country. Why didn't they use a sat?
Russia did it. China did it. Do we never first think to look at our own government? Those weren’t China balloons ya know. Do we not see them trying really hard to take us to war w China?
Isn't this used for mapping? So why would they map our territory if it wasn't for an invasion?
Matrix
Saw the spotlights on last night. Wondering if any connection.
I think they were going for this, but it was made in China so…
I remember when they were testing the lidar in my city.. had a few people freakin out before they ran the story in the paper 
“Lasers”
Eye for an eye
They're testing their ability to hit their targets by "lighting them up" from space. It's pretty obvious.
Wouldn’t that just be a typical mapping satellite?  Do we know it’s Chinese?  Could it not be Google Earth or a USGS satellite mapping volcanic uplift to predict eruptions?  Citation definitely needed. Or are you just making stuff up for clicks?
We did the same decades ago via the space shuttle and Reagans Star Wars program
That is what they want you to think, those were not human lasers!
love seeing China provoking the provokers
So it was always Chinese space lasers the whole time
Are we sure it wasn’t the sharks?
They are taking exact measurements of the planet to build a Chinese knock off planet. you can peorder but due to ww3 there will be delays
Don’t worry. Joe Biden and Kamala will keep us safe.
What makes you think it’s china?
You understand the US is the biggest and most meddling international surveillance operation on the planet, right https://t.co/pTJIAwx1py
President Biden ordered the US military to down what was described as a "high-altitude object" hovering over Alaska, the White House says
Should China be punished?
The question was, should China be punished for spying. Since we're run the world biggest global spy network, what should our punishment be?
Nothing
Sounds like you have zero of actual substance to add here
It sounds like I'm saying fucc them
Ok so nothing interesting or substantive, got it
China commits to using more friendly spy balloons from now on ( the shovel) https://t.co/7GSbIysWzH
More alarming facts coming from that China Spy Flight DOD briefing. tells Harris, “Pentagon was unable to jam transmissions of the #chinaballoon… we have a bigger hole in anti-surveillance technology than we would like to admit.” https://t.co/owGGASuQP3
Oh my that can't be good?
Yikes!
Harris, fight fight fight!
But hey…our military is learning to use pronouns!! Uncle Sam wants them/they!!
Wow, that's disgusting. Impeach these Marxists, please. We need to pray for our country.
I thought there was nothing to worry about?
Why is no one mentioning the fact that it had a living space with windows, a compressor for a pressurized and oxygenated cabin, an observation platform, catwalks? Where is the pilot?
So if you are posting another video and making another comment on the issue when Biggs said that he didn’t go to the classified briefing. So if he didn’t go to the meeting how does he this information he is telling you on tv?
Do you mean the pentagon couldn’t block it because the Chinese  turned the comms off?
That does not come as a surprise.  After watching the military and political climate, I have noticed many changes in our troops.  Training has become increasingly Woke, equipment shortages, technological changes slow.  The list is long.  All has to change rapidly
It is not incredible that Biggs gets a military briefing behind closed doors and is talking about it on Fox News which commentators are Russian agents. Biggs is a dangerous traitor
It is very difficult to believe you when you lie as much as you do
Andy’s mouth is moving, we know what that means…..
China invests in tech while USA invests in LGBT and diversity studies.  Wonder who is going to win bro?
China can see seams on a baseball from the edge of space via their satellites; but no, they would rather use a balloon!  Really???   This is USG fear rhetoric.  We should have shot it down, but invite China to be onsite when we recovered the debris--proof one way or the other!
Why did Biggs beg for pardon??
This isnt true. I can jam almost any satellite myself. 1 China doesn't have many constellations. 2 It takes orders of magitude more power to encrypt a stream, we already know where they are, rf &amp; physically. 3 ERP (Effective Radiated Power) is what matters, angle of beamwidth..
What about failure in 9/11? Why those failed to defend the horizons not punished OR else everything was sham except grave human tragedy. Why truth was killed to defame Islam &amp; Muslims &amp; to justify attack on Kabul to restore heroin for mighty drug mafia?
This is the guy who asked for pardon!  He has no credibility
For Chinese Joe to say the American people are not worried about this is a total sham!
And yet #Biden left it float completely across America before they shot it down! That is aiding the #enemy!That is #Treason! When is enough ENOUGH?
Faulkner needs to SHUT UP and let guests speak . My gawd she’s as bad as Geraldo if that’s even possible !
All can say is what the hell!
Why do you think it wasn't shot down at the begining? The ho- hum attitude,lies and deception. Of coarse someone's pockets are deep.Heads of Military,Intel, security,this horrible admin wants this Country to fall pray to their ways- woke,cancel culture and socialistic.
We are becoming communist China by allowing the CDC to target the non vaxxed.
Your refusal to report on vaccine crimes is not proganda, it means you are complicit of the crime and should be charged as such!
That's what happens when Xi has the American president in his pocket. Dereliction of duty!
Not being able to jam an electronic signal is major. I’m Just Sayin’ . . . - - - . . .
Biden probably ordered them not to even try as it took its week long cruise  across our country collecting intelligence ! IMPEACH THIS TRAITOROUS FOOL NOW !
We have inexcusable incompetence in the Biden administration. That makes the United States vulnerable in a lot of ways.
Harris Faulkner is a Damn Liar!
China is geo-mapping our silos so they can quickly send a drone strike in and end our nuclear program. This is a major problem!!!
Total #incompetence...  Or  Total #Compliance  You deride
This is not what the USAF spokesperson told us. He said they had ensured of no transmission by the plane. Is the still lying to us?
No the government had rather surveillance American than watch for foreign spies.
Frightening.  And Biden so screwed this up
We have traitors in our government.
The pentagon said it was blocked, apparently they lied again.
Pentagon lied again.
It's about time ! This is a wake up call. Give more to military. Stop being so tight. I assumed we had Alaskan National Guard on stand by... There's so much open land between Alaska and Montana there's no way that balloon would'a,should'a ,might have hit someone's house.
We should elected him as president!Our president doesn't have a clue about intelligence gathering. CHINA'S gonna lie.
Right uh huh you betcha. Are you really not understanding the concept of the military Harris and andy? They’re not gonna tell you when they jammed transmissions. Because you don’t need to know. I don’t believe nothing that woman says at all. Period. May God bless.
China gives both middle fingers to Biden..
  Good luck on a response from and his admin is too are too busy posting on Twitter what a capitalist he is.   Leaving this matter to the senile, old and confused is as per usual another disaster waiting to happen.
Hey fakener.  It takes time to figure out what is going on with the stuff they recovered!!  Get it!? Mass shooting again.  But just same old vitriol from a fake God spewer...you are spreading sedition.   And you know it!!
How much of a planned distraction is this event? Who besides the WHO and CHINA is watching the gun treaty at the UN. Biden will sell us all out
Ur president is a coward we will be boycotting him when and if he shows up for any talk about him trying to run for office
Ha...bigger hole....These Morons are busy gender bending their kids while they Country goes to the pit....
Trustless Trustee: Weaponization of the DOJ by the Chinese Communist Party
Who's this kid kott? Tell him to STFU. Come back after you get out of high school. JOE BIDEN has proposed cutting SS over ten times over forty years. Polls show Biden is a worse POTUS than Carter. Biden's the absolute bottom of the POTUS pile.
Why do i feel they been doing this to us all along, and they did want us to be super aware of them impeding in our civil liberties? well the cats out the bag and hes meowing. . . hahahaha we gotta stop fucking with american people, we own you
As Biden prepares to renew the DRAFT for all over 18..? A PENTAGON BRIEFING IS STILL ON at 3:30pm, EST, that knows NOTHING about "a smaller object"  just SHOT down on Alaska waters 2+ hours agoWTF is NEXTWar..          \                        or a:
It is a declaration of war against the country to which the balloon belongs, the balloon was in high atmosphere in an international space.
He doesn't care. All he does is stoke anger.
Its a FALSE FLAG to distract from Biden Corruption!!  Don't be fooled!
Your continuing attempt 2 speak on behalf of AMERICANS is laughable at best:What must Americans’ ENEMIES think “ you speak that’s IGNORED by you/Fox  2 support Trump’s support for Putjn in Helsinki while defaming AMERICANS’ intelligence:puts you in Trump/ Putin enabling 
AMERICANS’ MAJORITY support for the Biden Administration and EVANGELICALS’ UNITY and SCRIPTURAL SUPPORT of the Biden Administration overcomes Fox : like our Greatest Generation, AMERICANS overcome 2GETHER as we Republicans speak over your corrupt enabling of TRUMPISM 
Americans and Evangelicals are leading, inspiring, healing, and calmly are supporting our leadership in a time of divisive and opportunistic media personalities and politicians. You’re LEFT BEHIND with Fox  decades of toxic rhetoric as AMERICANS’ MAJORITY muted  you. 
The American-made, American launched FAKE “China spy balloon” went from “conspiracy” to fact in record time.  The empire of lies continues to be exposed.  Your FAKE “government” hates you, and they think you’re stupid.   They want you dead, and they’re killing you.   Here’s some… https://t.co/SsrlyQGeFa
China said it was their balloon.
So we believe China?
Normally I would agree with you although contacts I have talked to all say this is legit Chinese Balloon.
I love all these conspiracy theorists who have “contacts.” It must be so fun to be larping all the time!
I love these trolls who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about yet act like they do. It brings about a who new understanding of ignorance.
I'm pretty sure that Trump was the president 3 years ago. So the so-called conspiracy began under him?
What difference does that make Strawman?
Wait, so why would China claim it then?
So you’re saying it’s our own American balloon spying on citizens?  Is that fact or just assumption?
That was my hypothesis too
Nothing should surprise people at this point  Not so sure what to make of this yet  But I definitely knew about the American balloons 6 years ago
It’s always been a bio weapon
Love your energy Stew. Good job of giving me another alternative to consider. Thank's
it really was china though bro
FFS nothing surprises me I'm these dark days
So question. If American made and American launched…what was its purpose?
Yep, don't trust treasonous politicians who steel elections &amp; orchestrate insurrections.
I told you before
At the same time Pfizer quietly released their new batch of court ordered docs
I don’t know what to believe anymore
Could be
Words in Latin can be in any order they want REV1:7 Even if they shoot it down they will still suffer  ® Quarantine??? balloon??
Fake blue check! Loser! 
But China admitted it was their balloon and demanded it back
Two people whom I trust and who should be in the know. 'people who know things' Say this was not one of our observation blimps. The Q people say this was an attempt to map out military chain of command and I am prone to believe that narrative.  Right now China/Biden = same-same
They can't even write a good script anymore.  We see right through them.
Why does everrrrrrrrrrrything have to be a conspiracy
Was there English writing on “China” balloon? Thought I read that somewhere..
Thank you Stew for speaking the truth. I knew there was something more to this story!
They want us to get behind the fake agenda and support their war drum. Not going to happen.
Good report Stew, you make a compelling argument. Your likelihood of being correct is very high. I heard a report there were American parts on this balloon.
No hogwarts for these two!
And the Academy Award for drama queen goes to...
Makes total sense!
Woah that escalated so quick 
I always knew.  
My guess is the USA is up 2 no good with this 1…
 Listen to this! I knew I heard something about Balloons.
I said from the first day I saw this that there’s zero chance that’s from China. Of course it’s a U.S. balloon.
So the were made where they were found?...hmm sounds familiar.
Distraction
So They’re monitoring drug trafficking and security threats over the Midwest via a balloon instead of just posting up at the border? 
There was shrapnel in Japanese shells with "Ford" stamped on them, sold to the Japanese as scrap metal. So, English on parts is easy to counterfeit. Is it tracable to a US manufacturer??
Maybe trying to get a glimpse of Yellowstone season finale
1/ Divert attention towards a perceived enemy in order to foster general public sentimentality of distrust &amp; hatred towards said enemy (scapegoat). 2/ Utilise freshly-generated public perception of "enemy" to further political / elite agenda gain.  (EG: 9/11, Iraq, Russia, etc)
Why did China claim it was theirs if it wasn't?
plausible, but how do you reconcile the other balloons being spotted over other countries?  are those ours too?  seems unlikely.
Maybe it was a spy balloon by the Chinese..the same game that USA has played over decades?
Redacted said similar, but that it was a weather balloon.
Surely China would use satellites to spy like we do or at least use a different color balloon
Remember the Maine
satellites they are satellites
Hmmm. Trump balloons then?
Dude wake up. It’s a China balloon Biden has nothing to do with it.
What is your logic here? Because US military fighter jet patrols in our sky, so all other countries can do the same?
I don't understand, then why dud the Chinese want their ballon back?
China literally admitted to the balloon and asked us not to shoot it, also admitted to the second balloon over Latin America. And then, released a letter condemnation after we shot it. Lastly, they asked for it back…, your can’t be more wrong
This make zero sense considering China themselves said it was theirs and have demanded it back. So that makes this take look even more ridiculous
I would agree with you, but why did China say it was one of their “weather” balloons??? Not saying we’re not using them, I’m sure they are even though the military shouldn’t be monitoring its own citizens.
Everyone is saying China says it’s a weather balloon. I haven’t heard anything from china. What I have heard is only what our wonderful unbroken media has said. Think about that..
Stew.. Ask the angels to guard and protect you.
Note to self; surveillance / bad.  Aliens / bad.
Didn’t China admit it was theirs?
I said that the minute I heard about it. It’s so obvious. China this or Russia that. SMH
Well that's just a crazy conspiracy theory.     Today.  What will 2 weeks bring.  Well yah but. China Joe only did it that one time.  msm.   Nobody is interested in that balloon anymore
I can’t do better than exposing it, covering it and tracking it in real time. I also spent 60k last year defending myself against my own Congress. You know, just normal conservative American stuff over here. Living the dream.
Isn’t it possible China used American made parts in this balloon to troll is and cause the kind of reaction you are displaying here? Wouldn’t be hard to do.
The Ballon was a big joke. I laughed so hard when I heard about it. China isn't dumb enough to spy in a big white Ballon, but the sheeple believe it
our government wants us dead easy, in the cities but they need a lot more to target those in remote areas
You think Montana is the Midwest?
Since #Biden looked so hapless and clueless waiting to shoot down the actual spy balloon, he had the US military launch another one, so he could order it shot down and look tough.
Take down surveillance balloons designed to protect Americans and our border but put up balloons to illegally surveil innocent Americans.
Good read
Take the weekend off Stewey....do some bounty hunting,start rapping about commies.
The cabal running the gubmafia is playing US for fools. Do not consent, comply or cooperate with evil.
China has already admitted the balloon is theirs.  So the Chinese are taking the fall for the US government? Is that what you’re saying?
Did you not take your medication again?
Maybe it's a NASA satellite balloon that descended due to cold weather?. Surprised they didn't blame Russia, Yet...
As long as the media obediently follows the BIden propaganda and does not ask embarassing questions the lies will go on and on!
Why is it that suddenly this week there are American politicians questioning big tech. Where tf were they over the past 3 years. Don't be fooled and do not think for a minute that they are real. They are just as guilty as the people they are pointing their finger at.
Tbh well in my opinion anyways, most Americans would feel better if this is true bc that means we’re not sitting ducks about to get invaded while some weak administration sits uhhh “irresponsibly” in office.
Hey Stew, Lets face it, in 1963 the Security State was able to assassinate a US president and get away with it for 60 years.  They have been emboldened by that.  They know if they can get away with THAT they can get away with ANNNNYYYTHINNNG
If it wasn’t China’s wouldn’t China just say that? Seems dumb if it was actually US made that China wouldn’t just run with that. Instead they say it’s theirs but just civilian. Your arguments make no sense bro.
You make a great point. Makes sense to me. China hates us and our government hates us so either scenario is plausible, but probably more likely it's the US, which explains the hesitancy in shooting it down. And absolutely, China Joe is compromised.
Stop looking up and look at this instead
I think we need to talk to MI6 and Patrick McGoohan
Everyone knows how the elite get richer is by killing everyone on purpose… my god are you guys stupid
Brainless prat
You are all fucked in the head, attention starved greedy Americans. Ignorant scum and proud of it you all are.
You caught us - we invented a fake balloon to own the magats.  You fell for it, suckers - AHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!  Now go get your vaccine boosters we added extra LGBT to it for you!  Dumbass.
It's MY  damn it! That was MY S.O.S.   Investigative Journalism  WHY was the weather balloon  from China here  at Mr Xi Jinping Twitter feed   at the comments in his top post
This bozo comes up with some off the wall shit…what the fuck happened to you
China has got to be laughing hysterically, those stupid American people
Isnt this the idiot who is claiming Damar is dead?
Sad but true
Stew, you’re an ass hole!
Hi guy follow me and My youtube
Weather balloon  Come on man
lol wut an idiot
Lmao you won’t make it as long as Alex Jones. You’re way too stupid and gullible.
This is just another dumb #MAGA conspiracy.  How can the #ChineseSpyBallon be #American, if #China claimed ownership and protested actively?  It is a sin to use your brain for decoration purposes only!
USGS wants public input, including domestic #helium users, to aid the USGS in analyzing if there is an increasing risk of helium-supply disruption ...global shift from conventional #NaturalGas toward #ShaleGas, which lacks recoverable quantities of helium
We need to share the intelligence gathered from China’s spy balloon with our Allies.  F_ck China if they are going to stick with this bullshit story about it being a civilian weather balloon.
House Democrats running for cover voted against boss’ business partners.  - “Sorry, Joe. This time you’re on your own… moron!”  House Unanimously Approves Resolution Condemning China for Spy Balloon https://t.co/i4B5SdLyuv
Biden's weakness on the world stage has emboldened our adversaries in Beijing, Tehran, and Moscow.  Has there been a worse Commander in Chief?
Yes. That sentient turd you tried to overthrow our democracy for was THE worst president ever.
Donald Trump. Dovish was the word Abe used to describe Trump.
Let's support AZ rancher George Kelly. A travesty of justice...
JUST LET HER KEEP TALKING AND AMERICA KNOWS WHAT THE IE ABOUT
GOOD MORNING!
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
WE have to stop the Hemorrhage! Our BIGGEST issue is men such as Austin, Milley, they make us weak.
Says the guy who’s party is pushing for the US to just roll over to Russia.
Hope your boy was dumb enough to blow that pipeline…….imagine Libs pretending to be that tough. Hope you and yours step up and go straight to the front lines. Stop virtue signaling and step up. You ain’t getting the kids from RED county’s to fight your war this time.
We get it. Your Red state boys only fight against their own government. Thank god you weren’t around f during WWII. Otherwise we’d all be speaking German these days.
, pretty close. We think Goberment is a waste of time and for Zombie’s peasants who are looking for meaning in life. Good luck in Ukraine. We bailed out Europe twice…. Won’t be a third. Step up and go to the front lines. The Ben Stiller of Ukraine is counting on it.(Zelenskyy)
And who said Republican’s believe in democracy. The Putin is strong in you amigo.
never
This is the only title  Biden should have.
Probably NK too.
Remember Andy, you are a Russian Asset, so Moscow isn't an adversary to you, only your employer.
treason?
Jimmy Carter?
We need this guy!
Simple answer - NO.  can you and the republicans / conservatives please do something about this and stop playing the "go along to get along" game.  Many of us are more than done with this!
He's not our Commander in Chief.
Yes!  
No you and the rest of the gop criticizing Biden in a public forum is giving our adversaries what they want.
Dude - just quit. You are worthless as a politician
Maybe all those places are in an uproar because they can't count on Joe to stay out of their business like they did Trump.
Yes. Trump was the worst President by far. Not even close.
The difference is he can’t be bought off by dictators!!
Andrew Biggs is implicated committing seditious conspiracy. He must be capitally punished
Weakness on the world stage
Lmfao, yeah bro not kissing dictators rings is not weak you clown
Remember the guy who invited the Taliban to our country?
Weakness is asking for a PARDON,Andy
Yes, Donald J Trump. Draft dodger and traitor.
Traitor Andy Biggs is a lying PO who should be in prison!!!!!
The orange guy?  Remember, he's the one you plotted a seditious conspiracy with and then begged for a pardon (so I hear).
Biden's strength is his foreign policy successes. Nato is stronger, Putin is weaker and close to being overthrown, and the Chinese will think twice about invading Taiwan. Also, you are still a gutless TRAITOR.
This is what weaknesses on the world stage looks like Andy.
Meanwhile...
Hmmm. I'd say getting laughed off the WORLD stage is pretty bad.
Voted Against Certification Spread Disinformation Online Subpoenaed by 1/6 Commission Requested Pardon
Yes. This Guy.
Not that I know of.
Angry white boys.
Obama. He's serving his 3rd term.
Yeah, there has been a worse Commander-in-Chief, now that you mention it…
Bigger threats-
This is how the world felt about trump!
I can't stand a liar so you know I cannot stand Joe Biden
Not since Jimmy Carter!
I don't know, traitor.  How about a so-called "Commander in Chief"  who salutes a North Korean general in front of the dictator of North Korea?
yep your former boss I know you know who he is. he and the gop party keep running the country under. insurrection was caused by your ex boss and you and others. no pardon for you? 
This Is only Your Criminal Opinion Andy ,WE all know the Truth &amp; we all know your Friends with RUSSIA since you needed a pardon
Because, to Republicans, this is what strength against Russia looks like.
Says the #DomesticTerrorist
Donald Trump: - Saluted a North Korean general. - Publicly supported Putin over US intelligence officials. - Hosted the Taliban at Camp David. - Released 5000 Taliban fighters unconditionally. - Wrote love letters to Kim Jong Un. - Abandoned the Kurds in Iraq.
You’d think that if were serious about increasing border security after years of mismanagement under the Trump Administration, they wouldn’t have opposed and Congressional Democrats' efforts to increase CBP funding   #GOPClownShowContinues
Yeah, Trump, GWB and Reagan.
The only weakness seen on the world stage was the disrespectful clown show displayed by House Republicans.    Yes,there has been worse. Donald J. Trump
Now, on the Record.
Those leaders were never more emboldened than they were under trump. Putin admitted he owned trump. Iran restarted their nuclear program under trump. trump constantly heaped praise on Xi. When will you be arrested is the question
Shut up, insurrectionist. #GOPClownShowContinues
Definitely yes…
Trump put the USA's national security in jeopardy when he did NOTHING about the 3 "Chinese Spy Balloons" that flew across the USA while he was in office! He ignored them bc China ***FAST TRACKED*** Ivanka's trade marks while Trump was in office!
Obama, Bush, Clinton were all bad too. We’ve just been enlightened to all the corruption now.
Yes.  This one.
Weakness on the world stage' is when you have secret chit-chats in Helsinki with Putin.  Secret chats with Xi to get trademarks for your daughter.  Weakness is when you pull out of IAEA agreements, which allowed Tehran to expand it's nuclear capability!
The President has restored competence, dignity and respect to the office - all of which were missing in the previous administration. Sadly, you remain as a reminder
Biden and obamma are in a tie for corrupt, inept CIC
Why don’t you make another trip to Moscow and fix things.  We still want to know what was discussed and fix on that trip.
Trump is the one that cozied up with these dictators and yes, he is the worst Commander in Chief this country has ever had
Why yes.
Speaking of emboldening our adversaries, pardon seeker. 1/2
Thank you for your strong leadership President Biden 
... one siding publicly with Putin against his own country?  ... one watching the attack of the Capitol on TV while refusing to try to stop it?  ... one "in love" with the North Korean leader?  ... one praising every single dictator on the globe?
Look here Andy, you really should pay attention...
Trump had secret bank accounts in China ... He paid $200,000 in taxes to China, only $750 to the US ... China gave Trump $5.4M ... He owes $211M to the state-owned Bank of China ... he let 3 Chinese spy balloons enter the US worse Commander in Chief.
Today’s is a bunch of hypocritical cross dressers like #KitaraSantos
liar biggs here is reality. Biden 2x-5x higher approval than trump..stop the lies
Gaslighting instead of governing...the schtick of the historically seditious red party.
He's been the worst US Congress’ foreign policy leader 40 years! He watched Putin surround UK; no red line; Afghanistan Withdrawal; this week: Allowed CCP intelligence balloon CROSS our nation classified docs VP failure!!
POTUS needs to be impeached the VP too,  for Dereliction of Duty or at least Treason!  Just to name 2 of many reasons... 1. Not protecting our southern boarder 2 . China I have never felt less safe in my 63 years of living.
YES! This one and it’s time to arrest him!
How about the one you conspired with to overthrow the last election?
Yeah the orange ruble. I rest my case
Yes. One who called those of us who serve(d) "losers" and "suckers," and one who let a little rain stop him from going to a memorial ceremony at an American cemetery in France to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice during WW I.  #VeteransAgainsrTrump
Why does the hate America so much?  We will NOT go back to the days of the Confederacy to make insecure white people feel better about themselves.
Yup. . -#GOPSeditiousTraitors #GOPLiesAboutEverything
Uhhhhhhhhhh…. Pardon me? I mean pardon you.
Never
Speaking of hot air...
Yes. Donald Trump was way worse
He is the worst and Nixon was the best
Imagining you as president gives me disaster vibes. So. There’s that.
His predecessor, for one.
Beg Pardon Andy? Plotted any coups lately? #SeditiousGOP #SeditionInsiders #Pardon
NEVER in my lifetime!  NEVER!
First of you are a LIAR……..The WORST ever? that’s an easy answer :
Yeah. There's an NFT card to commemorate it ...
Andy Biggs-
Yep!  From 2016 to 2020.
In regards to the question, I nominate Trump.
Yup Andy, this one....
YES.... TRUMP..... HE ALLOWED YOUR CRIMINAL REPUBLICANS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT. THIS IS NOW OVER. WE ARE COMING FOR YOU ANDY.
Don't think so  On the other hand YOU ASKED FOR A PARDON AGTER TRYING TO OVERTHROW our government and the Constitution that I served and became disabled for, WHY DID YOU ASK FOR A PARDON?
You bet.  Your boy Trump. And, he wouldn't even give you a pardon.  #GOPClownShowContinues 
Andy Biggs begged for a Pardon from TFG along with several other republicans members...
Well, I'd say Xi's head got REALLY inflated when donnie did his bidding and pulled us out of the TPP. That not only gave The Chairman of the Communist Party of China economic and military primacy over the 13 fastest growing S/E Asian economies...EVERY ONE OF WHICH DID NOT 1/
You were saying?  Why did you ask for a pardon?
Supporting Ukraine defending against Putin's invasion doesn't make Biden look weak in Russia or China. Honoring the Pentagon's request to wait to shoot down China's balloon whose data transmission had been disabled until it was over water pissed off China. Tehran? Not seein' it.
Your party committed sedition and treason against the United States.  Trump handed Afghanistan over to the Taliban, and sold us out to Russia and China.  There is no party as compromised, and un-American, as yours:
Why did you ask for a pardon?
Lmao, President Biden has brought back our strength on the world stage after Trump destroyed it
yeah, a few years ago there was...were you not paying attention?
Yeah, the last one.
Ludicrous!
Not in my almost 63 years.
Yes, Trump, by a long shot.
I don’t think he has shown weakness.
OMG!!! YES!
He is worse than Carter on the world stage, economy, and generally running a country.
Any ideas on how to combat that? Or shall we silently consent
Wait.  I thought you’re pro-Russia? Pardon me?
I could think of a few.....
#TRUMPwasWorse
Why did you ask for apartment?
What’d you do that you needed a pardon for Andy?
Yep the one you supported in the insurrection!
Yes...Trump
14th amendment for you and your comrades would be solution but GOP stands for traitors and against the American Worker.
Obummer was close!
There is absolutely zero weakness about Joe Biden, our POTUS 
Yeah, he just lost an election in 2020 and incited the insurrection you took part in.  Why did you ask for a pardon Andy?
The previous one…
Uh… yeah! Trump!
okay, so you acknowledge that Moscow is our adversary.. I thought Republicans loved Russia?
Me!!!!! Who is Former President Donald J. Trump?!
Yes Trump.
Yes trump! Way worse Putin owns trump.
Trump
Are you drunk ?
I bet Putin likes your tweet.
You said it. Russia is an adversary and MUST be prevented from taking over other countries.  Fund Ukraine.
No Biden is number one for being the weakest
Your party's disrespect for the United States makes other nations think we're weak. It has nothing to do with Joe.
Such a fricken embarrassment to Arizona. Hypocritical , racist, seditionist, election denier but mostly a liar who misrepresents facts, blames, deflects and most of all projections. No credibility, integrity, honesty or decency. Exact opposite of who should be in Congress.
Your tweets are nothing short of childish sabotage attempts.    This may be hard for you - but try to be a man.
If you were being paid what you’re worth, you’d be screaming to raise the minimum wage. Cant wait until you’re in the country’s rear view mirror
Awaiting your indictment, conviction and expulsion from the 118th Congress for your role in planning and executing the January 6, 2021 insurrection.
Trump was the absolute worst.
Emboldened Moscow? The place that, under Biden, has lost half its army without the loss of a single U.S. servicemember?
Nope.
Trump is the worst and most corrupt EVER
yes, your guy trumplethinskin the coup plotter...and you helped
Yup. The guy you wanted to pardon you.
Why did you ask for a Pardon?
Tell us please why did you beg trump for pardon?
Trump was awful.
Yes. The one just before Biden.
Yes, Trump was weaker. Just ask Putin
Trump by far!
First of all, you're a liar and insurrectionist; to answer your question - yes, your guy #45.
Donald Trump
Glad you asked, why yes they have been!!! 
No question. Donald J. tRUmp
It was the GQP resistance to public health measures, like vaccination and wearing masks, that not only needlessly killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, but also showed our weakness. We are more vulnerable to both future pandemics and biowarfare that requires shots &amp; masks.
Yes, Trump was far worse.
Because the first balloon was a spy balloon and more important to China. And we have a compromised president. The second object is to get us away from talking about the first object
First line of attack from China is weather balloons?
Anyone else wondering why within days capital hill has a briefing on a balloon from china but, for some reason UAP doesn’t get the same urgency? #ufotwitter #uaptwitter
Happy Friday, and happy balloon day to me!! 🎉 day off for me and there will be cake. Lots of cake. Have a good day lads and lasses 💙
Happy Birthday Mandy. 
Nice!!! Thank you 
Happy Birthday Mandy 
Thank you!
Happy Birthday, Mandy! 
Thank you muchly!
Are you going to Watford tomorrow
Can’t unfortunately, going to a do instead
Trump watched 3 surveilance balloons from China come over the US and did nothing.
Senator Rubio on The Biden Administration knew the balloon "was headed to the continental United States well before it entered North American airspace ... they didn't tell anybody about it and they didn't do anything about it."
Check out me and new video about NASA. It's very informational and can show you #truths #NASA #ConspiracyTheories #Firmament https://t.co/FLEKKRUwO0
Marjorie Taylor Green is country bumpkin from the back woods of Georgia. Pretends she knows more than the FBI and the Pentagon. Homeland Security should be embarrassed. China Spy balloon is a distraction.
There's nothing now to stop China from sending dozens of balloons if that's what this is. Shooting them down is not a deterrent. The necessity of doing so may even encourage China to send more if it sows discord. Other measures are needed. At least Biden is not in debt to China.
A distraction to deter us from focusing on how bad he handled the China Balloon!
Are those balloons from China?
Must have a new Made in China product line coming out.
Xi Jinping administration's too dangerous problems seen from China's spy balloon problem
'Just screaming': 'Irrational' Marjorie Taylor Greene hurls profanity at spy balloon briefing https://t.co/FC7yECT7qX
At least they are making intelligent points. MTG is just a stupid distraction.
She’s a gift to the Democratic Party.  This is all theatre for a higher paying gig down the road, but before that, she’s going to turn a lot of voters away from the Republican Party.
The Republicans deserve her for the arrogance they’ve paraded around showing us for decades.
That would be fine if she was a Georgia representative. But she represents all of us, which is the devastating part of this whole equation.
Charming Southern Belle that MTG 
Unfit.
She will be performing a tantrum on the daily so she can see herself trending Expect it every damn day … it’s sick. If we could just #IgnoreMTG
I think is a male. Look at her.
it gets to the point that you can’t say anything because their behavior is so predictable
A tweet conveniently ignoring a # of other facts about the situation ... including, https://t.co/RqlDWnCGE8
Is that a serious question? The answer is Trump who turned a blind eye to 3 balloons from China. He infact   did NOTHING!  He did not even tell Americans.
Your periodic reminder that Jonathan Turley is Mike Lindell with tenure.
Turley was there to explain that what any American could read online in some cases constituted violations of the First Amendment and that those practices by government agencies and government officials should be stopped.
Jonathan Turley’s first driving license
Dan Goldman’s work, so far, as a House Representative is definitely 
is a clown. Aren’t they all. 
He is the living argument against tenure.
#dickPICcommittee
Turley proves it every time he tweets or opens his mouth.
Turley is a total disgrace. Spell check keeps trying to change his name to turkey. That works too.
Every damn day he’s an embarrassment to GWU grads. Every damn day.
Exactamundo
Jonathan Turkey
Difficult to tell them apart.
Or "Mike Lindell without polyurethane foam."
What’s he ever actually done? Has he argued y to o the Supreme Court?
He's a disgrace to your field and to
Goldman is a beast.  
where, trump or prager u?
Give 'em hell, Goldman.
Always has been, always will be a clown.   I actually got second-hand embarrassment from that one.
Big “I almost joined the Army, so I can speak as an authority on military matters” vibe going on here.
Goss can't even be trusted not to share 100% "Nobody believes that shit" junk he finds online during a China Balloon panic 🙄 He's a transplanted embarrassment sent from the south/east States of Hell. I'm not reposting the clearly Fake AF video, but... he was happy to spread it https://t.co/ylGQKypyyE
Them: Define Useful Idiot Me:
His drooling over our governor was enough for me to realize he’s a hack.
Other than military assets data one thing China learned with their balloon is wind flow data. They were able to map the wind patterns from Canada into the US. Biological weapons have been used by China for millennia, in peace and war, wind flow patterns may support a bio attack.
Worst than that... but then again the Shadow Government is an accomplice.
If those balloons are from China . .   . . do you also have American party poppers?
You understand the US is the biggest and most meddling international surveillance operation on the planet, right https://t.co/pTJIAwx1py
President Biden ordered the US military to down what was described as a "high-altitude object" hovering over Alaska, the White House says
Suspend all non-essential trade with China.
CNN thinks the object was shot down because of all the flack Biden got from republicans on the China Balloon. Not for airplane safety Biden cannot win. Lordy
The train derailment in Ohio is way more important than the balloon from China.   But capitalist media is into selling hate, not explaining actual health risks (posed by capitalist corporations).
The Nord Stream revelation by Seymour Hersh is 100 times more important news than balloon. But Western media go nuts about balloon. Making such a big joke of themselves.
While mostly true, China is trying to distract you from the massive surveillance balloons
Marc Elias from the top rope. "Mike Lindell with tenure" is the most savage burn I've ever witnessed. This tweet is like that penultimate frame of the Zapruder film when you know the outcome but they speed away anyway.
Dude, did China buy a pack of balloons from Costco with all that they're sending over here?
When I opened my bank account I got a free toaster. Did Trump get a free balloon from China when he opened his? #NORAD https://t.co/LbJ0emNQHg
Wow, Trump really does live rent free in some people
The #GOP just held a 3-day congressional hearing on election meddling and right-wing censorship, where Congress members and former FBI agents EXPOSED EVERYTHING from Covid tyranny to the Weaponization Of Government, and all #FoxNews wants to talk about is a China balloon?
They were told not too.. talk about election fraud.. think about it.. Why hasn’t Kari Lake been a guest..
She has more concrete evidence than any candidate ever put forward and crickets!
Or not talking about how NATO-backed Ukraine is using chemical weapons against Russia and executing prisoners of war, not human rights violations, but also war crimes
So very glad I switched to DISH from DirecTV.  Newsmax never disapoints.
Hey Matt, you're not a very good journalist &amp; your attempt to "spin" the narrative into something exciting is really quite dishonest. Please stop.
Not sure how to break this to you...
And it wasn't broadcast on lame stream media they spent 0 minutes covering it
This is true. Why air a press conference that gives us no answers?? And the obsession with murder trials. Sheesh. Do better by the way anytime #FJB is on or you air his “quotes” I turn the channel.
It’s unreal.
Well some of them like Tucker and even Hannity did report but I agree the Fox Station in general should be doing more on reporting these committees, Newsmax has been but their viewers have been limited
Well considering FOX News contributed millions to the Clintons, what do you expect?
That’s not fair, they also had a piece on Elizabeth Hurley’s latest bikini selfie
Becaue they are compromised...Paul Ryan among others.
No MSM, including Foxnews, is fair and balanced. They report what they’re told to report, by their boss, who has a direct phone line to elites in the “Soros” level class
Diversion technique and Cheena balloon purpose recognized.
We know who they take their orders from …
I think the release of the Twitter files did more than congress ever will.
You’re right Matt. It’s gross that they are still under gag order to hide the election fraud.
100 years ago the Chinese were depicted as a swarm of “soulless” yellow wasp 🐝 killer bees invading America with hands in everything. Today, the narrative is the same, from intellectual property, buying of US land, Tik Tok, universities, business and balloons, China is blamed! https://t.co/xxOH41lgiw
Photo circa 1880s. Over 100 years later, the US is still hell bent on playing imperialist colonizer; interfering in China’s domestic politics; expanding through military measures (see the new U.S. ghost bases in Philippines) and depicting China as some villainous competitor.
This is what a real spy balloon looks like — very high-tech with lots of equipment for navigation, communication and surveillance.   This is from the U.S. military.  Now compare this to China’s weather balloon. https://t.co/C4YMyh7oBn
Versus Chinese “spy” balloon
Scott Ritter said the China balloon is for "high altitude atmospheric testing to get specific water particle content for global warming"; atmosphere is around the entire globe so balloon has a global reach to collect the data. 15:33-16:33 is informative
Good find! Its exactly the same shape as the WW1's surveillance balloons.
That´s a Blimp, not a balloon, Dirigible is any lighter-than-air craft that is powered and steerable, as opposed to free floating like a balloon.
See them quite frequent in SGP. 
That's a real military Zappelin.
Always knew they are just pushing another fake "Hollywood" type theme.... The liars are so good at publicity stunts to instill fear
It's so obvious from even looking at the balloon that it's equally suprising and shocking that this kind of propaganda works in the US.  Anyone with even the most basic knowdlege of these things can see from a 10 miles away that this is a normal weather balloon.
It’ definitely not a weather balloon, Chinese government didn’t say so, they just said ‘for research’, even in China, nobody believes it’s a ‘weather balloon’
U can navigate a spy ship in the sky u wouldn’t have one aimlessly blowing about hoping to capture intelligence w no way to man the balloon
Waiting for the Russians come up with these bad boys
1/ This is a high altitude balloon born science platform, in this case one developed in Australia by the University of New South Wales (#UNSW) in partnership with (#NATO)..   This is NOT a "spy UFO", shooting one of these down, is a massive destruction of science equipment.
this whole thing is ballooning out of control ;-)
The real America without balloons.
I could design smaller and weather balloons don't redirect to silos and nuclear power plants.
China state media reported the balloon project years ago, said multiple purpose includes military
Obviously, the balloon shown in the video is not the same as the "spy balloon." 
Different shapes same purpose
Isn't the point, that they are ALL balloons? Haven't China got an alleged "Space™" program? Why don't they just spy from the sky vacuum??
China's spy balloon：
The Americans are not even subtle about it.  The Chinese are playing a patient game.
完全是对中国的恶意诽谤
All shenanigans trying to incite war
The balloon they shot down belonged to the US Department of Defense
Political theater to terrorize American into giving up what little freedom we have left
China is sending us balloons because they are the only thing missing from the Biden circus.
Then China will intrude from both sides like they intruded USA by spy balloons. But ours will say nobody entered.😂 https://t.co/sfpsFBg5cg
Well that is the reality, we are not strong economically to survive economic attack from china &amp; even on army comparison china is way ahead in all 3 format air water land &amp; bro your tweet was on pakistan and its crisis, y jumping into another topic when u discuss about this ?
An unstable neighboring country is your threat which will manifest itself over time. So bankruptcy and ensuing economic crisis will be opportunity for China to establish control over Pakistan and will be  security headache for India in long term.
Yea an unstable pakistan is headache for india , wrong China alreadyhave control over  by CPCT but no one can stop  bankcurphcy  they have to pay more than 73 billion before 2025 even china US IMF can’t pay on there behalf especially when 2023 is full of global recession
Then expect more Chinese intrusion thru proxy pakistani terrorists. China supports terrorism and our PM visited China 5 times as PM and 4 as CM. He loves China more than any politician in India.
lol evenfor years use to think it was a UFO only this time they get to know its aspy balloon,soalready have other way of intrusion especially tiktok &amp; xiaomi tower near US army bases, as for visit as for visit who not visit china,u are saying like US president never visit
US knows how to protect their borders and  keep their enemies closer to watch. Second, they don't fear china like ours do. They won't hesitate to drop nuke inside of China if their army enters and attacks them thru any means. Ours will say, nobody entered. 
lol do u think this made US public feel better , they are demanding to ban TikTok on which gov said it spied your data &amp; to remove xiaomi network tower near US military bases in US but there gov haven’t taken action on this big thread
Definitely people was aware of Chinese intrusion.  Don't know if they felt better. U have to ask them. Didn't see the president of  US lying on TV...
U should stop comparing US to other country when it compare to china intrusion , US can handle any China economic attack but other can’t, even japan Vietnam Philippine &amp; other 40 countries are avoiding talking on china spy balloon
So u r saying ours lied about intrusion due to fear?
Or else what else it is we can’t compare in any factor with economy military influence power , tell me which country other than US is not suffering from ,u think india is as strong as US??I know u are debating more bec of your ideology, its more from poltics than geopolitics
Why not stop imports from china if u r suffering instead of 29% increase?
They just shot down another spy balloon from China? This is starting to get really concerning.
They didn’t say “balloon” they said “object” they aren’t telling us exactly.
Really . Well that's freaking wonderful
Now they shot down a 3rd over Canada. Something fishy is happening.
That was hours ago...
Okay well whatever I don't look at the news. The fact that they're literally surveilling us on our bases is not refreshing at all. Do you think we'll be at war with China on our own soil?
We already are, all that farm land and mines they are buying up.
I believe this new object was our own little ploy to make Biden look in charge. It's altogether too convenient isn't it?
do u seriously believe anything from the pedo or the sissies running the pentagon....all propoganda..smoke and mirrors
How would they know it was from China or not? Even if it was one of our weather balloons, all of its components would have “made in China” printed on them? Just a thought.
Sniffer Joe said it wasn't problematic.
They just SAID they blah blah blah  Never take their word.
"Starting"? Check out the time our Aircraft Carriers were sitting in dock 2014....
Probing us. We will be fighting China by 2025. 
False flag
Reeks of smoke and mirrors. The Biden administration got blasted for letting a balloon cross the entire country. Now a small size one gets shot down over desolate Alaska. Looks to me like our own government is trying to make Biden look like a hero
It wasn’t a balloon. It was about the size of a small car
That was only a decoy because they blew it the first time.
Every city ripped our jobs away and sent them to China.       Hiw deeonis this plan of Treason against the people of America  how long along did it start.    What did they sell and what did they get.   The last 80 years needs to be looked every one in state city fed
I wouldn't believe any reports about this, especially those coming out of DC.
Don't worry. The state department said they didn't know what it was.
Makes you wonder if all this is a distraction to something else.
We don't know what is in the balloons either. That is what I'm concerned about.
They are satellites.
At least this time it was down before it crossed our country! Lol
Or did they? 
Starting to get a oncoming false flag event vibe..
Yes is concerning and has been, at least they shot this last one down!!
Does it say "Made in China" on the balloon? If the Chinese wanted to spy on us, it would be inconspicuously using hi-tech. They don't have the technology? They did land on the dark side of the moon. Something neither we nor the Russians achieved.  False flags to distract. G5W!
It probably is from China but we the people don't know much of anything about it.
Watch till the end
I told you it is wwiii
I'll believe they shot something down when I see it. Otherwise they are lying and it's another distraction
Starting? Where have you Ben since the potato stole the election? (Not trying to be mean, just saying he’s been a horror show)
They’re saying it was a cylindrical object. I think they shot down ET! 
We’re being tested on response time. Next time we might have several hundred balloons floating our way with warheads on them.
They won't admit it was a ballon. They said unmanned object.
10:1 odds it was one of ours.  Put out there in an attempt for this feckless admin to save face.
WASN'T A BALLOON
They 'told' us they shot down a spy balloon
Don’t get to excited until you hear on the emergency broadcast system, you have incoming, in 7 minutes.
Yes it is.
99 Luftballoons go by!
If I was China I would be sending droves of balloons just to waste our ammo and piss Biden off.
Shot nothing.Bullshit and bad for ya  Happy wk end.
I think.its.fake propaganda.
I m Azhar Iqbal from Pakistan My house and my entire family were destroyed in the flood I rented a room and am staying there now  Asked for help from everyone but got nothing from time pass So please  help me
Good morning
#China #Balloon - Only 2 comments: Either 1) Its #RedChina probing US defenses as US/others do as standard operating procedure prior to actual war, consistent with recent saber rattling, or 2) Its just political theater to distract us from something else #politics #MAGA #Military https://t.co/tc2eHIAPBg
Indeed. We run the biggest spy network on the planet. https://t.co/pTJIAwx1py
Stupid response .  You first said that they did not blow up the first balloon over land because it wasn’t safe.  Now when I prove you are full of shit you send me something that has nothing to do with the discussion.  It must be all the boosters messaging with your brain 
It must be all the inbreeding messing with your brain, Lurleen.   We do 10x the amount of spying than every other country. Why would anyone care some other country reciprocated?
The moron is changing the subject 
It’s ok to admit the truth hurts, Cletus.
1 of 2 The Truth: You were trying to say that Biden administration was being responsible letting a spy balloon fly across United States.  Then they shoot on down over land a week later.  When I point out your hypocrisy you send articles that the US spies more.
Why would it bother me if the US spies more?  GOOOO USA!!!  China has the right to shoot the balloon down AND WILL!  The real question is what is the real reason Biden let the spy balloon travel all of the way across the US!  Stop trying to change the subject!
“Why would it bother me if the US spies more?  GOOOO USA!!!” You are… not bright
Do you really think you did something there?  Of course I do not care how much America spies on other countries.  Why does it bother you if America does?
Do you not comprehend the levels of backlash that has happened in the past few decades because of meddling and duplicitous behavior by the CIA going back to the 1950s?
What the hell does that have anything to do with our discussion.  I get it….Hey look over there because I was looking like a fool on the first topic.  Admit your comments were foolish and I will be happy to discuss the new topic.
Any dipshit who says "Gooo USA" in the face of decades of spying, meddling, toppling governments, and triggering tribal warfare revolution and terrorism, is not a serious or informed person on the topic. This is 2023. No country should be spying. No one is above the law.
The USA will become the center of World War 3 because the USA lies between China and Russia. The US is already surrounded by Russia and China. You can see on the map where China's test balloons come from to see how quickly the United States Defense can react. https://t.co/oHyNFIuhQh
The logistics of supplying an army across the Pacific is insanity.
Terrifying to think about
Do you know how wide the Pacific Ocean is?
Buahahah mistrz 
Now do NATO.
Russia is also between Europe and the USA.  Oh, and China would need to cross the entire Pacific Ocean  Oh, and the US Air Force and Nay have the capability to intercept and down any advancing fighters, bombers, or ICBMs
Let the war begins
somebody already tried "surrounding" Pearl Harbor and we know how that ended.
Oh dear...go back to school and pay more attention to Geography, Economics, Geopolitics, Mathematics, History, Physics,...actually, forget school, just don't post things you don't understand exactly. There are so many dumb ideas in your post I can't even start. USA surrounded? 
???  Has John ever seen a globe?   Hey   you're a bit closer to this guy.  Can you please explain to him that the earth is a sphere?   Earth to John:  USA is NOT between China and Russia.
incorrect
Hahah pure schizophrenia don’t over work that single brain cell with your first critical thought reject
Are you clueless? How many US bases surround China and Russia and how many Chinese and Russian bases are near the US? The US has over 800 foreign military bases, China has like 5.
Don't dream every day that you are the center of the world, no one pays attention to you, and you are persecuted delusional patients.
Dear #Russia &amp; #China can we ALL, including the #USA, just start thinking about the CHILDREN for once?!? This whole #SuperPower thing is not working out!! We are spending far too much $$$ on polluting weapons of mass destruction  For WHAT? It is so dangerous on many levels!!
Balloons over America are not from China. They are from banksy https://t.co/vKSvgObgIC
Let me make sure I understand this.    A surveillance balloon from China floats all the way across the US.  Now they’ve shot down basically a “UFO” over Alaska but they know nothing about it?  Let me grab my boots.  Bull💩 is getting a bit deep.    https://t.co/Zr44NBBAI5
You can use Microsoft Paint?    Good for you little fella!!!  I'll bet soon you'll graduate to Excel.  Then you'll start making the BIG BUCKS!  Oh, and next time you steal an image off of VectorStock you may want to crop that part out.  Stop wasting my time you waste of space.
Those of us who own a home and can afford a PC
You mean your 1000 sq/ft condo you paid $1M for in California?  Dumbass
And I can usually pinpoint them without any effort. You know, because they're run so well  Houston for example, run by Democrats and it's a bankrupt piece of shit  So well done.  That's definitely something to be proud of  You say you're educated.  I have to say, it doesn't show
Why don’t you stick to rating the local waffle house on yelp and leave the  real thinking to the qualified. Biden won in Houston, Austin, Dallas, and El Paso the only reason he lost TX was the large amount of trailer parks outside of the cities.
Gotta admit that as a distraction these have been 100% effective though. Regardless what you think about them - they got all sides distracted lying discussing them for what...a week now? Do you remember what was going on when they started pushing the first one?
Twitter hearings
I don't believe they had started yet. We were at the 'Hunter admits laptop is his and demands DOJ investigate the people who exposed it' stuff, as well as 'Hunter's laptop proven to implicate Biden in multiple crimes' beginning to creep into the actual mainstream
Oh yeah - and the Veritas Pfizer expose vid had just dropped
yep didn't think of that.  Hunter actually started a lawsuit over the laptop then had to say "but I'm not saying it's mine"
My guess is this is another Chinese balloon that was beginning a grand tour of the US.  Calling it a UFO gives China and Biden both deniability in the whole affair.
Valid point sir
Project Blue Book 
Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
I dunno. I think it's about this deep....
But they couldn't shoot the balloon down over Alaska.
I couldn’t agree more!!
Great tweets
Okay, hear me out. Not sure if I really believe UFO conspiracy stuff BUT!!!  My mom was a teacher on Elmendorf Air Force Base in  70s &amp; swore she saw UFOs.  I know she wasn't lying, but always wondered if it was really just some military object, you know?
Anything to take the eyes off of the Congressional Hearings….They may be so desperate that Project Blue beam will be right around the corner
It doesn’t matter what you think.
It's an omission of being weak with the first one.  He reads the mob then makes up his mind 
Never ending nightmare from the Government and the Vatican.
I suspect it was a wayward life raft filled with helium from Cuba. They probably killed some illegal immigrants!
Yep… think you nailed it… this is all horse squeeze.
My guess is that it's a target drone.
I asked sources that work the pipeline &amp; a former AF.  The AF is TIGHT &amp; the Pipeline executives were  “told” it was a balloon.
This administration is always late to the show. Until there is pressure on them they will not act and when they do it is usually a failure
I'm sure you'll find out more.
The only thing I have heard is that it was an "un-manned object" flying at 40,000ft over the coast of Alaska and was a danger to civilian aircraft.
Exactly 
Worse, the military admitted that they did not see this threat until it was already over Alaska.
Amazing how Biden got an instantaneous " do over". And now Canada is involved?  This is some deep doodoo.
And today they shot one down over the northern Canada. It’s getting really deep
Something is wrong, these should not be crossing the Bering Strait. This admin needs replacing.
Yes, The Kirby S_IT Derby 
No, it wasn’t Whoopi leaving the country 
All a distraction from Epstein list.
Sad, they can see a person  on earth from space, but could not identify what they shot down.
I think you misunderstood.  I don't support Biden
The fact that you're so stupid, and brainwashed makes that abundantly clear.   Enjoy your evening with the rest of the herd you dumb fucking sheep.
We don’t know if they shot anything down, all we know is sleepy Joe looked like an absolute fool for a week while a surveillance balloon floated around America and they had to do something.
That’s the best part
I agree!  And this illustrates the main reason this Biden Administration must be Impeached!! There is ZERO Credibility. The level of trust necessary to govern is just not there. They have spent any equity of trust they might have once had with repeated lies &amp; false narratives!
I mean if the government is blaming Russia and/or China for something you can pretty much guarantee that it’s the US doing the BS
One did active work, the other probably wasn't more than just a real wx balloon the chicoms let the joint chiefs recommend shooting it down.
This world is getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
Yeah, that's the ticket. A Democrat president will get the job done. If you want to turn your country into a shithole, elect a Democrat.
This just illustrates how stooopid they know their voters are. They don’t care what we think at all.
You know they don't have to tell you anything, right?
Yeah, that about sums it up brother. F--kn Klingons are coming because the Scamdemic and Climate Change bullshit failed. This is what they said would happen when the Deep State Globalists plans failed.
The #RedBalloons are a distraction from #HunterBidensLaptop sent as a courtesy by Biden's handlers in Red China.
Whatever the case, UFO, Chinese balloons, Klingons, This senile stuttering prick has no idea what they shot down.
101% Biden Propaganda
I'll just wish there were consequences for lying. The old adage " liar liar pants on fire "this guy would go up in flames
They are full of shit.
CARTEL DIVERSIONS  over North America so tons more dope can come over our Biden border while we chase ghosts Naw, BUT using "heat  seeking missiles" on the last two `UFO's` is an indication they were `enemy-? aircraft. Not f'ing balloonsAll we get is bullshit, 24/7...
Everyday at just about every major airport they launch weather balloons to get winds and temperatures aloft.  It is rolled into the weather reports and forecasts for those locations. So FJB is blowing up weather balloons to divert attention?
CHINA AND THE US APPEAR TO BE BLESSED TO BE IN A POSITION TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR  DESTRUCTION.HOWEVER, I DISAGREE WITH CHINA ON THE BALLOONS.GIVEN THE DENSITY OF WAR CLOAKING THE WORLD,I WOULD SAY BOTH BALLOONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN,AND SHOT DOWN QUICKLY. https://t.co/4C5L46mZ14
Joe Biden is a Chinese proxy. Period.  He was installed in part by China &amp; serves China.  Biden's policies are China's policies, which is why they generally benefit China &amp; punish Americans.  He needed the manufactured balloon fiasco to deflect away from this. The more you know. https://t.co/05XfwAOCgF
Was the China balloon a distraction from the environmental disaster in Ohio?
The fact that we aren’t seeing wall to wall coverage of the vinyl chloride train derailment and explosion in East Palestine, Ohio, is insane.  An entire town can’t return home because the water is contaminated, livestock/crops are destroyed, and reporters are being arrested.
Thanks, yes I saw that, when I first saw it I thought that tanker cars full of crude oil had crashed
It’s horrible and MSM is suppressing it
I saw it on Fox News, but I didn’t see a lot of coverage.
It’s horrible
Thank you for posting I had neard of this either.
Suppression of this kind of thing by MSM tells me that there is something very bad happening that they don’t want us aware of.
Probably. The media likes to cover up things. For example, 2-3 years ago there was a warehouse/battery fire in my home town of Morris IL. Barely made the evening news in Chicago.
It’s an environmental disaster
I was thinking the laptop and classified documents.
More then likely, just like them shooting down something over Alaska.
Lucky the balloon is from China. Big enough. US dare not to use it as the "Iraq wmd" to start a war. Otherwise this Ohio stuff will be "done by the Chinese balloons".
I remember them saying there were 3 undetected balloons that passed over during the last admin.   ME: Undetected? Then how do you know about them?  Admin: Uhh.. China told us?  Me: Really? What else did China say? Did they withhold other info from the president?  Admin: RACIST!
A third   Unidentified  Flying  Object   has been shot down.
Love all the TDS stricken people replying
They weren’t undetected. They were unreported. And that info was undetected by Trump b/c he refused to read morning briefings.
Well, maybe somebody should’ve come to him
Isn’t that what the briefing is? 
I'm sorry my tweets hurt you.
Funny the few people who feel the need to push the CNN/MSNBC/Liberal rhetoric on a tweet by a nobody that somehow got 151 likes. Kind of like yelling at a tree. 
They balloons dropped altitudes which is the only reason we saw them now. You can't be this vapid. Grow up.
The 181 likes on this tweet from a nobody (me) indicates that you are being salty as you talk out your ass. 
Ok, guy that actually paid for a blue check mark like some simp. Cute you think that Twitter traffic gives you any credibility. Twitter is the new 4Chan. Calm down.
Did your diet as a child consist mainly of paint chips?
You are a grown ass adult trying to be Twitter famous. If anyone here has lead poisoning..
You try to inject misery into other people's lives by leaving condescending replies to everything they say. If you don't like me, block me. Or at least just move on. You made your first impression. Scold all you want. is SUCH an appropriate username.
This is the internet. You don't want your feelings hurt, then private your shit. Don't cry cuz you ran out of clap backs.
Who's crying? Ffs get over yourself already.
Dude. You keep talking to me when you said I made you miserable. It's fucking weird. Not trying to kink shame tho...
Your kids must hate you.
Unreported. Not undetected. Do you trumpets know how to read ?
#fakenews
China Spy balloon sent back its first pics from flying over Missouri https://t.co/u4MSRPJJSn
Could the balloons from China...🎈 Be spying on us to see how feminized the men of North America are yet ? 🎈 Testes...Testes..1..2..3
Hey man...it's possible. Testosterone detector. Serious intel.
I remember them saying there were 3 undetected balloons that passed over during the last admin.   ME: Undetected? Then how do you know about them?  Admin: Uhh.. China told us?  Me: Really? What else did China say? Did they withhold other info from the president?  Admin: RACIST!
A third   Unidentified  Flying  Object   has been shot down.
Donald Trump  0 - 3 Chinese Spy Balloons.  Joe Biden 3 - 3 Chinese Spy Balloons.
They were detected, just not reported to the public. Do you honestly believe the military tells you everything that happens?
The reactions show that there are people who recognize the message. Sorry if it hurts to view a different opinion.
UFO shot down over Alaska a week after China spy balloon traversed the country. Maybe they learned a lesson. Why is it so hard for them to say “We screwed up, but learned from our mistake”?  It would be taken much better than the lies and excuses they’ve been giving. https://t.co/hbS1TgRpd2
Did you ever think there might be more useful information gained from letting the balloon travel over the country to see what China might be interested in?  China has satellites in orbit that can see everything anyway. But the balloon's path may have given us all the info we need
The same way it was better to leak nuclear technology to them and let them gain the ability to nuke us?  No!  I had a Top Secret military clearance. My job was to protect that information. We have better ways of getting information!
Anyone else think these "ufo's" shot down these past two days is just to deflect from China's balloon?
Sigh! So silly to create a stupid narrative of spy this spy that. China uses satellites to do their spying, just like the US. Balloons are from the US in the US by the US govt.
JUST IN - North American Aerospace Defense Command is monitoring "one or two" more potential spy balloons — Global News
i just want to remind everyone that the giant mushroom cloud in ohio everyone is posting right now happened on monday and why the fuck weren't you paying attention https://t.co/stCoDyWAgA
They said it’s safe to go back. I mean yea if you don’t mind a bit of cancer
Actually we were talking about the Harry Potter game, critical discourse to be having on the tl
another thing that will add to my probability of dying from cancer by 60 list
Trains derail and destroy entire small towns in the US all the time. That's just how it is here.
i didn't even see or hear anything about it until late wednesday/early thursday.  and i'm from ohio.  didn't see any news posts, trending topics, or hear from family back in OH until then
I feel like everyone is forgetting the giant earthquake that also happened on Monday  But then again I also know news is different in America. Are they even talking about that?
If radioactive we are all fucked which I doubt it was, still got bad Chemicals spewed into the atmosphere 
I first read this as "the giant mushroom cloud in Ohio is posting now"
I'm not in the US so I don't have a clue, but I've seen a lot of people saying media is avoiding/supressing the issue completely. Train derailment (weeks after a strike over conditions that could lead to this outcome was busted) releasing Phosgene over a city seems relevant, idk.
I've been on precision scheduling for my news intake
This was the best option
It's because again, Ohio. Takes a while for it to sink in that's not normal anywhere.
I was paying attention actually
I suspect the earthquake in Turkey &amp; Syria, which was understood to be horrible *immediately*, occupied people's minds more than what seemed like just a bad train accident at first.
I mean. Something pretty awful also happened on Monday that’s pretty hard to ignore. But this does deserve more attention.
Idk, nobody has said wtf it is they just post this picture
It's cool it's just a giant cloud full of   *checks notes*  phosgene gas
honestly a lot of people in my class had no clue this happened in our county.
Mainly cause of school
Thank you for paying attention sir
Living about an hour southeast of it I was busy checking the weather to see if we were fucked
Probably because theres effectively a tradtional media blackout.
i actually knew about this before you did
Why wasn't I closely following a story that happened during the work day and received little coverage in the news?  Yeah, good question, who knows.
Because woo scary balloons!
Because all the mouth breathers were worried about a Chinese balloon
What are we supposed to do about it
All hail the Glow Cloud
I WAS AND ITS BAD ITS THE BHOPAL DISASTER ALL OVER AGAIN AND THERE WILL NEVER BE PROPORTIONAL RETRIBUTION FOR IT
"Is Ohio in the US?" Joe asking his advisers. So were the winds blowing North Easterly this weekend as Joes first time staying at the WhiteHouse for a weekend since taking office! Figured poison being blown over Delaware and he couldn't be seen in a mask as Virus is over
Every 10th tweet I see is saying this, that no one is talking about it
I was into the death cloud before it sold out
Ofc it's ohio lmao
It’s because of that fucking balloon
Media focus was only on the stupid balloon
Because I know absolutely no accountability will come from this. You fucks would know this too if you gave a single shit about Ohio politics
Fck the rich.
Government &amp; big media distracted us into looking for balloons from China, while we have an entire town soaked in toxicity &amp; railways running without necessary safety features.
It was just another balloon from china ! Here’s their message https://t.co/0uZnpOvtep
Like all Alaskans, I appreciate and am proud of the professional work of our Alaska-based military. Today’s shoot-down of another unidentified object over Alaska takes skill, precision, discipline and proficiency. (1/8)
Real intelligent of you. How about you nice to China.
💯 Those balloons and flying objects are probably not from China but created by our own government…
More balloons from China are spotted. In interest of world peace, please do not shoot. https://t.co/aZK1dbRlGG
Yeah. That dummy pilot is a meme about the balloon from China now.
One of the greatest comedies ever.
BREAKING: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that on his order a U.S. warplane shot down an object that was flying high over northern Canada, acting a day after U.S. planes took similar action over Alaska. https://t.co/2qphJ0ObtY
This has to be b/c of the train derailment, right?   Otherwise it would be a lot more obvious how strange it is that sensationalist news w/ declining ratings aren't running a visual like this on screen 24 hrs a day to get views  twitter.com/KATUNews/statu…
Is this the end? Do I need to bug out?
Why US warplane? No Canadian war planes in the area?
Things that make you go hmmmm
Order?
I need to know what the object is
Ha ha. Order? He doesn’t “order” the US military to do anything.
On his order a US plane shot down the object ??   He does not control our military..
On his order?? LMAO
Lol clearly nobody knows how Norad works
Universe War 
What if all these flying objects and balloons turn out to be from aliens and not China? Then what? 🤔😅
Excerpt from The New Republic article: Know Who the Balloon Incident Is Really Embarrassing For? China. - https://t.co/2KjngboGRu
Why did China need a spy balloon fly over the US when they could have got all of the top secret US info that they wanted from Trump's laptop?
The Department of Offense just released another statement confirming why Trump did not have the 3 balloons from China shot down on his watch. They were not used to spy on the USA, they brought smuggled goods into the USA for the Trump empire to sell at a huge profit.
Is this true and verifiable? I hope so…
No, I just made it up
It was a dream there for a minute
There is no department of offense
Hahaha
I know. I kinda glazed over that part!
And they all had Ivonka’s copyrights.
makes sense
you prolly not far off there !
They were probably packed full with cash for his bribes.
Anyone who is not favored by the media is often doing good for the his/her nation and the people. And we know government departments can also be captured.
Awful lot of “weather balloons” drifting over from China/Russia these days 🙄
Two or more potential spy balloons being monitored by US military - with one airborne over Canada
A Harry Potter game, some balloon from China, and Marjorie Science Taylor 3000.
I assume everything the Biden regime says is a lie.   Because it always is.
We’re past “assuming” and smack dab in the middle of “knowing.”
Yuuuup!!!
100%.
This guy makes Orange Man look like the Pope!
It’s always the complete opposite!
Is working!!
“I don’t regret that at all. Romney didn’t win, did he?” ~Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, in 2015 interview with CNN’s Dana Bash regarding lies he told on Senate Floor about Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign.
He’s had so much practice that it is natural.
You mean Biden Crime Regime??
At this point, that's not an assumption, but an educated opinion based on facts, supported by history.  The Biden Administration is everything wrong with Government.
Well dah  !
Agreed
He is America’s Lier in Thief.
No assumptions necessary.
Worse than a lie.
It’s called “confirming” not “assuming”
Bayes approves this message.
How sad to be the head lie-teller.
Every damn time!
Politicians gonna politician
If Biden is talking Biden is lying.
Well, you know what happens when you assume?
Rational assumption.
And if they immediately deny something? Then they are totally guilty of doing it.
Correctamungo Sir ! Biden Lies …
Why not, no one is ever held accountable.
Safe and effective, most secure ever, we did not blow up the pipeline, nobody thought the taliban would take over etc
yo ever offer you $ to turn on Trump?
Me too
I don't know how you are relevant
Agreed lying and corrupt 
Whatever you say.
And everything they accuse someone else of doing they are in fact doing it
Every time Joe Biden lies his eyes get a little beadier.
A deliberate, well contemplated lie.
Preach brother 
"Joe Lie-Den" is an accurate nickname for the President 
Every single word
My new go to for all of his tweets:
It’s easy to lie when you control the narrative and everyone covers for your lies.
Especially whoever is tweeting for him.
Spoiler alert, please!!
It’s like what many of us assume about. For the same reason.
Well you Rebels better skedaddle before Big Guy swings by with his trusty Lie Gun eh?   Vamos 
Guys, Catshit knows what he’s talkin’ about…for real.
"not a joke"
Why switch it now? I mean it's only been like 50yrs of consistent lies...... Most popular potus ever according to the Blackrock msm ...
a lot of gaslighting. I said, "Biden called Tyre Nichols 'Tyler' during SOTU."  libs: "no he didn't"
But he rigs elections so he's golden
I completely agree. But do let me know when any regime of any party tells the truth.
It’s a good starting point anyway
No need to assume, it IS
You know what they say about assuming…..
Funny thing. If he said the earth was round I would begin to wonder if it really is.
Yup!!!!
Don't believe anything until after it's been officially denied.
Biden didn't lie when he was 2
Because conservative Republicans *hate* liars…  This guy with you?
Joey's presidency is a lie that started in a basement and has gone entirely too far!
A lot like tim pool
Lie until proven to be truth.
The aircraft shot down was just a let’s go Brandon blimp!
Yes, it truly is.
If the FBI is involved my crap detector hits 10 immediately.
Everything they have done is repugnant and void and not bound to any American citzens.
I need to tel you my theory about the new “object” that was shot down over Alaska. I’m sure you are better with research and such but where it was shot down over Alaska is an oil field called prohdo or something. Could this have been a revenge attempt for the nord stream?
Well you assume wrong .
Always.
holy shit
“I always wanted to play it down”
Ya right!!! 
Lo that was the trump’s
When you ask straightforward questions, you get straightforward answers. setting the facts straight on the “Twitter files”
¡Es correcto, Señor Catturdo!
Correct 
Biden by one door, Trump by the other and certain doom behind one of the doors. What question do you ask which one of them to save your life?
Remember when the US killed "terrorists"in Afghanistan and it turned out it was a family. Why do I have a feeling that this object they shot down isn't what they want us to think it is.
Safe bet until proven otherwise.
That would be a very safe bet.
It's hard to believe that they now shot down a second spy object over Alaska today.  How convenient.  It may have happened but everything reported from Biden Administration I now question.
Good assumption
And always do the opposite
"Even if they said the sky was blue?"  Yes because Biden would think it's yellow or green, and lie that it was blue. Basically.
They’re bringing the Alien factor in…it’s the only thing to save them.
They didn’t shoot down shit today.
You missed the part about a proven lie
Well, even a broken clock is twice right each day. It will be lying the other 86398 seconds.
Everything the Rs accuse the left of doing, they are doing. Hypocrites.
Exactly….He didn’t order to shoot down jack shit!
If you think opposite world and you will probably get the truth from thinking this way every time brandon speaks.
They are the least transparent and the most dishonest administration in our history, and that took some doing since we had Obama.
You mean the intelligible stuff? 
Yes very suspicious about this new object allegedly shot down not sure if true or blowing smoke
And since he repeats the same ones over &amp; over again, I only have to fact check once.
One scary thing is…. whenever there is a national emergency, Biden’s first reaction should be “what is the best action for our country and citizens?”  Instead, Biden’s first (and last!) reaction is “which reactions cause the most headaches from media…which make me look good?”
If his lips are moving...he must be lying.
Anytime anyone in the Biden administration says ‘let me be clear’ it’s a lie…the Obama mantra on repeat…
Imagine that..lol
Yes, and now the planned downing of a smaller white balloon to make him look tough. He's trying to appeal to us, like a tough on China guy....total JOKE. See right thru you, Joe.
TRUMP LIED 30,000 TIMES, THEN LOST IN A LANDSLIDE
He always has that wicked grin when he lies.
It isn’t a “regime”. It’s a democratically elected administration
Only when their lips move.
I do too.
Yes it is
sometimes, Brandon lets the big tells slip. Just let him ramble a bit. Maybe lace an ice cream cone with speed or something and throw it at him while he’s onstage. him fending off secret service like a dog snatching a roasted chicken would be entertaining.
There ya go. Enough said.
I took this stance January 2009
Sounds a lot like the Trump regime
Anytime he says “let me make this clear” you know a lie is coming
A regime can lie about anything  if it has fear underpinning it.
How do you know for certain the stuff Biden says in his alien language is a lie?
Always.   Always has been. Always will be. #LiarLiar
No that was the Trump administration!
You misspelled Trump
Not really a wise thing to do. As soon as they tell the truth once, they will then make you into a liar.
I presume because it always is.
Not everything,  I believe him when he says "sghwalphhhizzahumpff"
All govt. is a big lie.   Always.
EXACTLY!
Yes!!
This is a lie.
You can go ahead and apply this to every political regime you have
Or incomprehensible
They’re consistent.
‘The healthcare plan will be ready in 2 weeks’
100% truth is not Biden
Ain't it the truth.
when you realize you're an old crank who's spending your golden years perpetually lying to gullible people and verbally fellating elon musk
Unfortunately. 
The lie is the Biden default.
Government in general.
Whatever they say there’re doing… it’s the opposite 
Good policy
Duh!?
You have a firm grasp of the obvious.
That would be a fact
TFG = PAB
Assume everything that the news media, the government and health officials say is a lie.
I assume everything you say is a lie because it always is.
Marxists must lie
And you assumed everything the trump admistration said was truth.  So sad. PEACE
Solid bet 
That is the truth, Catturd!!!!!
Not always.  Sometimes it's incoherent babbling which is neither a lie nor the truth.
While the rest of us were sleeping, the mediocre, the inferior and the evil have gained control of the world.
All politicians lie they denied area 51 for years.
Is it bad when a president lies?
Says the Trumplican supporter that supports the house GOP  d*mb committees that literally say Hillary sabotaged herself lmao.
Manchurians lie.
Biden's dead.
You call Biden a liar? After we’ve put up with Trump?   Your hypocrisy is grotesque, and this accusation is some perverted form of ‘projection’ more than an accurate description of Joe Biden.
Says a cat shit
Good assumption. The man lies even when he knows everyone knows the truth.
Yes.  Assume all statements to be lies until evidence unequivocally proves otherwise.
a lie or two, a truth, another lie or two
I figured this latest shoot down was one of drones just to hide Bite Me’s ineptitude
assume away Phillip.
What politicians haven't?... I'll wait..
All this because the groovy grapes couldn’t book a gig 
The groovy grapes were a wannabe REM and y’all were straight bad
ALWAYS
Joey was well known for his lies and plagiarism, going way back. The press used to call him on it, back before they became shills for the Democratic Party. Never seen such sycophantic slavering as these propagandists do now. They act like he walks on water. Worst president ever.
Only when they open their mouths.
Politicians
Trump ALWAYS LIES. Your turn.
100%.
Agreed!
That’s a safe bet
Come on man?
Decided to do a thread on East Palestine, Ohio. The Massive environmental disaster that happened several days ago. Whole town evacuated. Caused by poor maintenance, Norfolk South managing to get the government to repeal braking laws, and loosen hazardous material regulations. https://t.co/F81utLo5F0
Apparently I was wrong, its alkaline. Someone mentioned that it felt oily. Because the train was carrying multiple chemicals, and its not been disclosed what, probably safer to avoid rain if possible for at least several days. 
Update video on list of chemicals, some of which were found to have entered storm drains, and contaminated soil being buried/covered over with replacement track. Pt 1
A very thorough thread:
This just keeps getting worse. The manifest pt 1:
South Carolina and Texas also just had train derailments. Its been confirmed that the train derailed in Texas was carrying hazardous materials.
RIP 3 chickens
Chickens from several families, pets, wild animals, fish in nearby rivers.
Just imagine the strife we export through our neverending wars. This was an accident, imagine doing this on purpose 1000 fold. We as a species really have regressed the last 40 years. You would think that we still would be sensitive to world war so soon after the cold war.
You'd think, but unfortunately people no longer think for themselves. They let this or that news pundit or politician tell them what to think. Its crumbling around them and nothing. And our government imperializes, exploits, murders and no one is even aware.
There was a haze in the air 50 miles north the day after the controlled burn.
And who knows what other chemicals were on the train, hopefully enough people start talking about it that the government actually has to look into it but knowing either of our corporate parties, it'll just be platitudes and promises.
The EPA filed legal document yesterday I think, and they list all of the chemicals. Which includes several more than first described. From the same guy’s TikTok you posted.
Glad to hear it
My favorite fact about VC/this clusterfuck is that the OEL is 5 ppm for 15 minutes and 1 ppm for 8 hr and it takes ~3000 ppm to smell it and people claimed to smell it miles away.  Even better that it's heavier than air so you know, that's cool too.  And the phosgene thing, etc
And there's like, 3-4 other chemicals they were hauling too. Its an absolute clusterfuck.
Yeah, the character limit really cuts that down.  When Elon Musk gives us our unlimited characters I can give it a proper 3000 word diatribe filled with facts
Almost 13 years after Deepwater Horizon and glad to see that we’ve learned the right lessons… We live in the darkest timeline.
please unroll
This is how regulations tend to work.  Once the truth of the matter is determined, jail time should be on the list of potential punishments.
Massive railway disaster after rail workers were denied the right to strike for better conditions...  Looks like the onus of responsibility for this accident goes pretty high up the government chain.
This thread is a disaster
where's the coverage? ????? Come on guys/gals.
The Media needs to be talking about this but their Corporate Overlords won’t let them.
Looks like mushroom cloud
#whitenoise
Look at the bright side! At least Pete didn’t cause a plane crash!
Officials say....well, we all know what officials say, right?  All together, now. One...Two...Three...  NO ENVIRONMENTAL HARM OCCURRED, AND THE PUBLIC WAS NEVER IN ANY DANGER
This is what happens when regulations are too loose. There are consequences. Good piece by Will Hutton in the Observer on this.
We got it coming.
Capitalism, bringing a taste of Bhopal to the homelands.
#NationalizeNorfolkSouthern
But they vote for less regulation, "small government" etc. Can't be unhappy when the policies you vote for are enacted.
This is why you DON'T get rid of safety or environmental laws   I consider this your warning.  But you know this already and choose to put us plebs at risk for your profit
My father used to inspect trains for the FRA. Some didn't want to listen to what he instructed them to do.
The small town of East Palestine was not entirely evacuated, the zone was so small.
How far does the impact go? Any word that people incarcerated at OSP in Youngstown have been dealing with fumes? I was thinking of them particularly since they can't leave...
Should there be an Independent investigation outside of government and corporate? Which may be difficult to find.  It seems that both are biased. Corporations should be responsible for innocents sickness and death if they are the cause and know the results of toxins.  I bet CYA
pls unroll
All them shits gunna come down when it rains too.
This is an epic fail.. move the fk away from there STAT.
wait? this was not done by Russians  ... or at least Maoist China???? I mean they are the scapegoats for everything that is sh** in usa
My dreams are coming true about them damn balloons from China.... it begins the war of all human kind. 😭😅
I say we release a trillion party balloons upwind from China and see what happens.
Chris, You’re repeating propaganda and lies again. Everyone in Trump senior staff said no balloons from China were reported over the US During Trump’s presidency.
#Bmoviemaniacs  Wait, I thought all the white balloons were from China!
I wonder if China got the Intel from Donald Trump's laptop, where to send the spy balloons all over the World?
BREAKING:  On the orders of President Biden &amp; the White House, the US has just shot down another object over Alaska.  I wonder how the GOP will try and attack Biden for this one.  Biden protects America using information and maturity.
Wrong laptop, you meant Hunter Biden laptop silly.
Joe Biden to borrow money from China to cover expensive missile costs to shoot down cheap Chinese objects  https://t.co/e0m4Bp2MeM
10% for the big guy ...
I just want to make sure I have this correct: calling a virus that came from China a Chinese virus is racist but calling a spy balloon that came from China a Chinese spy balloon is okay.
These people have no problem with double standards and hypocrisy.
Balloons are cute !
Pretty much actually
Yes, ma’am. 
Correct.
You are correct. Lol
Hmmmmmm go figure but the narrative of the left is always right because they get away with lying about
Clown world we're living in! 
Yes, and I fact checked it.  It came from bat soup.
Good point.
Bingo!!!
Makes zero sense!
Nice.
Since when do we care what they don’t like how we name things
Nailed it.
It’s never wrong when they do it see. 
Messed up world we live in haha
Yep!!!!  PDJT had DOJ set up the Chinese Initiative JUST for preventing Chinese spying, but......  They complained to Brandon about "racism" so he canceled it.....  (They paid Hunter for something)
Seriously right!
Makes no sense!if it came from China it’s Chinese.
Yup, that glaring democrat hypocritical double standard ! I saw that too.
Point
I’m confused also.
My Girl...
Seems about right.  It's all about who's doing the calling.
Meh. I dont tarry their namecalling. I dont play the pronoun woke crap. Its a chinavirus.
I thought that same shit
Trump was three weeks ahead of them.
Apparently so. Whatever fits the narrative I suppose.
Give that lady a cigar!
In fairness, COVID mostly cake from the NIH.  Should be Fauci Flu, or, Fluchi, if you will
It was OK, now they are not even admitting what the last two are or where they’re from.
Got it!
All messed up
Hahauauaua
Yeah I noticed that
I wouldn't bet on the balloon coming from China....just because 'they' say so.
I agree, they should call it the Chinese Wu Han Faucci virus. Just my opinion.
Perhaps it means the balloon didn't come from China.
Yeah but the quickly changed the following ones to objects.
Truth 
Great point!!
Good hypothetical
I think it's because the balloon was white and not yellow. (bada bump) 
It all depends on your politics.
Was it very symbolic that it was unleashed near the Wuhan bridge?
We know who writes the PC rules
For now it’s ok. Just give it time and they’ll be claiming racism
Trump didn't say it!
Go out an have some fun life to short.proble shorter with this peace of shit we got in the White House forget all this shit an have fun. We still  you
Damn. Don't I feel stupid not thinking of that a couple of days ago?
Can’t make it up. Crazy
You got it. Double standards at the expense of the American people
English language writings on it? I call Alinsky tactics...
Kinda like how they just occupied the Oklahoma capitol?
Yes. Balloons aren’t a protected intersectional class by the left yet so it’s not racist to address them by their country of origin…
Yes, exactly.
Perhaps we should ask since her scrounging for money cause her hubby left her is not working out.
Liberalism 101
Hilarious isn’t it
Only if you’re democrat
WHAT A JOKE!
I think they have told too many lies. They remover what they said or who the said it to.   Big mess
It just depends on who's saying it. If you're a Commie Democrat, then it's okay.
Nothing wrong with calling Covid the Chinese virus, it is!
It’s funny cuz it’s true  
The difference is China made the balloon who really knows the true origin of the coronavirus?
Which country should we blame the so called common cold on that’s been plaguing us forever.
That’s correct! 
Ya it gets confusing eh. I think that’s the idea.
Yes, that correct! I'm Irish and German, that's a nasty temper! I've lived in Italy... the people are lovely!
It’s mainstream media and Hollywood clowns that set the stage it seems. Soft propaganda is so powerful.
Definitely don’t draw slanty eyes on the balloon. Or pop it with chopsticks.
Lol so true
If the logic cannot be applied universally, then it isn't logic...  It's Propoganda!
Liberalism is a mental disorder
Or a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome. Those liberals love our Chinese attackers.
You can't make this shit up!
You mean the Kung Flu
Trump called it the China virus so that's why it's racist. Yeah because Trump is racist remember?
So food from china isn’t Chinese food ?
The virus was American funded and ballon’s are most likely American distraction from Biden’s treason
Pretty much, but calling the Democrats environmental cultist is just what they are. None of them are independent thinkers they just line up for the koolaid and vote how they are told….
Don’t worry about it you racist, bigot, homophobe…. (Sarcasm here). But seriously it’s definitely ok when it’s coming from the commie-dems and fake news..
Biden and his adminisration and leftists and woke people all are as mixed up as can be,all are missing one brick shy of a full load.
Absolutely! It’s called Democratic Hypocrisy which happens every fucking day..
Democraps make up the rules to suit their own needs
Its not a baloon from china, nor a spy baloon.
That’s because this whole administration is in China’s pocket China is holding them hostage. They’re laughing their ass off at these balloons what
Dem Tard  logic
Kind of crazy isn’t it.
Almost exactly 40 years ago, amidst the cold war, this memorable song was born, text by the late Carlo Karges, R.I.P.  #Balloon  #F22 #f22raptor
And the Balloons are full of Bio-Virus', so let's make sure they get into the jet stream and move around the earth. Then pay Bill gates for financing population control.
You seriously don’t know the difference? LOL .. I’ll help you. The virus wasn’t SENT to the US to spy. It’s a virus that affected every single country. The ballon? Sent by China to spy. I hope that helps 
That is the Joe Biden administration
Of course.  Its a democrat in office now. A PLANTED democrat.
That's right. Welcome to Alice in Wonderland. Up is down, down is up...blah blah... just to FK with us all. They make the rules to this madness. sickos all of them.
F the china virus
Shows the lefts pea brain mentality
Kinda sorta
One set of rules for dumbocrats another set for normal folks.
Exactly fucking hypocrites!! Fuck them bitch ass fake fuckers!!!!!!
For any black magic spells. Check profile. Want someone to convert from gay to straight, want to find someone you lost, want your business to boom, do you need a promotion at work, do you want to stop your partner from cheating, want to win a court case. Email on profile
No shit! These people are absolute idiots
Man Republicans are stupid as fuck
Because they are crazy!
#Albuquerque #NewMexico typical UFO activity after dark every single night.
You can’t make sense of stupid
Hey Harry, are you worried about all the spy balloons coming from China? Maybe not because your Chinese.
A laptop that contained copies of classified documents and belonged to a a Trump aide was turned over to federal agents today.   That’s the laptop we should focus on, not the fake Hunter Biden story.
If China were smart they'd start sending over rainbow balloons. The government would be completely paralyzed from doing anything to it
So what the hell got shot down over Alaska today??
Isn't the point, that they are ALL balloons? Haven't China got an alleged "Space™" program? Why don't they just spy from the sky vacuum??
This is what a real spy balloon looks like — very high-tech with lots of equipment for navigation, communication and surveillance.   This is from the U.S. military.  Now compare this to China’s weather balloon.
BREAKING NEWS: Given that Trump’s attorney-Jim Trusty-just handed over classified documents that Trusty told the FBI were documents that were electronically copied to the laptop of a Trump aide, it means TRUMP IS SPREADING AND SHARING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ALL AROUND.
And why is Garland not doing anything? Everybody else be in Prison.  But of course, not white rich People. The Laws are not for them.
Please. Stop saying Garland isn’t doing anything. It only identifies you as someone who only reads headlines. If you read more than that, you’d know that simply isn’t true.
At this point, why even respond to the ‘Garland is doing nothing ‘ crowd . They just subpoenaed an ex VP! Huge
Was Jim Trusty subconsciously guided to become a lawyer because of his name?  It feels like something out of Batman or Get Smart that he is TFG’s lawyer.
Actually, there is some interesting research out there on the influence ones name has on shaping who they become, and what career choices they make. Fascinating stuff.
I always think of Senator Whitehouse of RI. 
it sure as hell does
Tracing is easier with digital transfer than with paper, no?
But...his e mails, maybe?
So, now we really have a laptop situation? Irony at it’s best!
The Republican Party deserves every bit of the fallout and damage that will come from this as I have always believed in my heart he will be found guilty of treason, and he will not be alone.
Do they have really big keyboards for his fingers?
But hunters laptop…
Something I haven’t seen anyone mention yet is the possibility that the laptop has been scrubbed. Is that possible?
Hey #GOP Hypocrites, let’s talk about this!!!!!
The only reason that dunce took classified info was to sell. Many people came to this conclusion as soon as it was revealed he had it. He monetizes everything. He’s broke, was never a billionaire.
I never had a doubt this was happening.
Next up! Espionage
It's almost like he should be incarcerated immediately or something.
Exactly. Likely sold secrets. We know Jarhead must have to get $2 billion from the Saudis
Since one description inferred an aid in an outside agency, like campaign or PAC - without any clearances - and a thumb drive -&gt; worst assumptions of containment loss.     SMDH, oh boy.
#LockHimUp
Isn't it illegal to digitize top secret documents?
Hence the misdirection to Hunter’s laptop! Every Republican accusation is a confession! 
Knowingly and with conscious of guilt!
Ok. So when does this arrest and perp walk happen? Seems like everyone in the country knows he's committing many crimes, but the DOJ stalling and dragging their feet to protect a pedophile. Ugh. Smh.
SO ARE Prince$$ NIPPLE$,ivanka and Mr. NIPPLE,  Jared
Blind Freddy could see that.  Hurry up Jack Smith
Is Trusty seeing the handwriting on the wall? This is a huge admission by this Trump lawyer.
Now do Hillary.  Come on man...it's not even a crime anymore to be passing around classified documents. That crime was vacated in 2016.
I could swear you used to follow me
Selling
Cool. And yet he’s still not being charged for anything? Did the DOJ ever think that the reason he was placed into the US presidency by putin is that he wouldn’t ever get in trouble for committing espionage because the DOJ would be too pussy to prosecute him…..?
And yet he will throw everyone under the bus to save his own skin.
Not surprised at all.
Not that these are necessary for a solid case but …
They are Finally Figuring Out What We All Knew At The Beginning Of August 2022!! When He Had His Saudi Golf Tournament &amp; Met With Viktor Orbon.Then We Found Out About The Documents! I Don’t Know,Is There Really Someone Watching Him? Doesn’t Seem To Be!
Of course he is
Oh no say it isn't so
TREASON
This is top of criminal activity! It’s way more compromising of safety of the country than even having in possession in a resort that hundreds of people come and go thru.
He's. In. Trouble.
We knew he was, this is just proof. It’s like… we all know he’s wrapped up in JE’s, proof would just confirm it for those w their heads in the sand.   Hopefully they can use this to subpoena all his electronics.
Boom!  &lt; something I have said before. But, I keep using it!
Sounds like Trusty is trustier than trump.
Jim Trusty.  sorry that’s just funny.
#LockTheOrangeTraitorUp
But but but Hunter Biden’s laptop is much more concerning, Right?
Exactly
That alone should put them in prison now. But he's still playing golf and raising money.
Well, it is interesting that in 2009 Lee Child wrote a book called Gone Tomorrow.  14 years later we have classified documents.
Trump would not be able to digitize a document.  This aide did it for him.  This aide was Trump's digital secrets bagman...
Daddy Mar-a-Lago CROOK!
Egad. Laptop owned by Trump aide found w classified docs scanned onto it.   Wonder if these docs can be traced to what should have been in empty classified folders found in MaraLago.   Serious situation. #reversethedystopia
No surprise there!
I AM SURE THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER RIGHT?? (SARCASM)
Normally one might request direct evidence that Trump shared the classified documents with Russia…oh wait, he did share them with an aide who didn’t have the security clearance required.  That’s enough for me.  #LockHimUp
Lock up that traitor!
Red Alert! Paging Jack Smith!
Not at all surprising
There was also a thumb drive.
So, do charges against the aide get filed before Trump?
So, now we really have a laptop situation? Irony at it’s best!
Ironically, #trump-laptop will be trending soon.
I think this might be bigger than hillary's server
And we wonder why surveillance balloons are around and a device shot down that’s the size of a small car…Don King Con sold us out
ARREST TRUMP! TODAY! TOMORROW IS TOO LATE!
Or selling. Or trading. Or blackmailing.
specifically, a “current” Trump aide
On an unsecured laptop
I guess we know why Hunter Biden was trending earlier 
And the #laptop belongs to a PAC
So the "LAPTOP STORY" belongs to trump!
Trump purloined those documents for the purposes of sale and/or leverage. Hence, US intel agencies must base their damage control assessments on the presumption that sensitive information is already out in the wild.
Damn Lock Trump up now!
Where's Hunter stand at in all of this
Admire your spice. I worry about what would have happened had trump succeeded. Do you know if the powers that be has plans for that? At least now. What would that even look like?
The horse is out of the barn,
SUR-PRISED???
So did these two.
Holy shit
Nothing about this implicates Trump, just his aide. Trump will say he knew nothing about it, and it will be impossible to prove otherwise. Keep looking.
I propose we call it the Chump Craptop.
LOCK THEM UP!
And how many people, i.e. Kushner, Vanky …had access to that thumb drive for nefarious reasons!?
We should now be hearing Republicans screaming about the aides laptop. Do we have a name yet?
I heard there’s a poll proving that if this story was published prior to the election, Biden would have still won.
Classified documents on Trump's Laptop and a Flashdrive--- Trump's Aide works for Trump at his "Save America "PAC
It also means that Trusty is protecting himself. You know he turned this over without Trump’s permission.
No one is surprised. A bunch of American intelligence assets have died.
It also sounds like Jack f’n Smith is dropping the g’damn hammer.
Damn! Just arrest him already! How much do you need? It is maddening!
Oh Hunter's laptop. Oh Hillary's emails. Oh Biden s sunglasses. Oh Obama's brown suit. Then there's the American traitor and coup strategists (ok I take that back) stealing sensitive information and getting Americans killed - crickets
Don't that beat all?
Can we start saying "Trump's Laptop" now?
and getting paid millions
Move over Hunter. It's gonna be all about Trump's laptop! 
I'm old fashioned. I just figured that they copied them. And then passed them around.
Are we waiting to see if hackers get into any other devices on that property and pull United States classified documents?
I reallllllly hope they are monitoring trump very closely or we are all screwed.
Who didn’t think it was a red flag when he met with Putin privately without translators?
I can't find any stories about this from other journalists (just to verify, ya know?)  Do you have a link?
I just wonder how many thumb drives are in the hands of our adversaries.
And he is selling it too, you can bet on it
I wonder how much money was made from these classified. I still think some serious files r in the casket.
No big surprise there.
Was that aide cleared to see the documents?
Tip of the iceberg.
The Trump Laptop we need to hold people
Geezus that is bigger than hunters laptop 10 fold !
Did Trump pass out thumb drives at his Saudi golf tournaments?  Like party favors?
Welcome to TRUMP’s LAPTOP scandal
Trump can smell a dollar all the way from Moscow.
But her emails……..
And yet…where is the accountability and the consequences?
Selling not giving
Probably on AOL if we know ex-prez P.A.B.
You're using present tense.
World Wide  Web
A Trusty Trump lawyer? Can it be true? Just how trusty is he?
I thought Hunter Biden had the laptop issues...
Hi to Jack Smith.
Like that want already known now there is proof. People better go to jail starting with the white orange Jesus of Floreeda.
I hope that was Steven Miller’s  laptop.
Who knows when Defendant Donald first put his filthy hands on documents. I suspect in 2017.
I think it means his aide was sharing and spreading around. I’m sure at the direction of DJT because that’s how he throws his ppl under the bus. When will they learn??
It’s like watching a hot air balloon floating across the country and waiting for it to be taken down near the Atlantic Ocean.
Jack’s so on it.
I asked a govt. contractor friend why Trump didn't make copies of the docs &amp; leave the originals so nobody would know.  He said they are printed in such a way that can't be copied.   I'm at square 1 again.   Why make a fuss with ignoring NARA &amp; subpoena if he could make copies?
Hard to argue with proof, eh?
Finally, a laptop was credible evidence of an actual crime!
Of course he is. Did you really think he wasn't? And I'm sure he made big coin while doing it. That was his purpose for taking the classified documents in the first place.
Can we all meet here? 
It looks to me like Jim Trusty is doing some CYA before all hell breaks loose against Trump.
I think hell is close to freezing over. The sharks are circling my plank is waiting
Don’t forget that Trumpf NEVER does anything w/o getting paid.
I am hard pressed to think of a name for copying classified information to a thumb drive or a laptop  Espionage? Who is allowed to do this?
The aide will of course be thrown under the bus and Trump will deny knowing them. And on and on it goes.
And that can be charged as espionage. Intent is everything. If someone has a few and overlooked it and did not share with others, it’s rare to indict. But,Trump hid them, held onto them when he was given a subpoena and now he has given them to someone else ?
Talk about the "laptop from hell" 
Finally. The E word. What so many of us have long suspected &amp; have been waiting for. It would be revealed as a slip of the tongue or a bragging admission. Like the sudden body count of our assets abroad wasn't clue enough. Or the laughing Ruzzians in the Oval. Or Helsinki.
Who’s surprised. The amount of corrupt mishandling of classified documents is beyond the pale
Which aide?  Scanning documents marked as Classified is a conscious action.  Why was this done? Of course, once digital the documents can readily be transmitted or copied to a portable drive.
Sure is.
Oh crap.
Yeah...that hasn't been a crime since 2016 when the FBI said it isn't a crime to have an unsecured cloud server in Norwalk, CT or a personal one in your basement while sending classified info to staffers who are married to pedophiles and he receives them on his laptop with porn
Geez!!!
Holy Cat Shit Pajamas!
Good name for a lyer, I mean lawyer!
Hunter Biden's laptop is a smoke screen. They always project what is really the issue.
#Trumpslaptop Is anyone surprised?
Traitor!!!
Arrrrrgh!
The copier machine was probably working nonstop too.
DOJ: Oh would ya look at that, more evidence to go with the tons of evidnce we already have on trump"..hmm what to do do
ABSOLUTELY
Shocking, yes. Surprising, not at all. TFG has been selling air for decades, once he learned (after becoming president) that state secrets had actual value, he almost certainly started looking for the highest bidders.
Everyone who worked closely to Herr Trump, were turned into criminals and traitors to our Country.
We know! And he and his kid in law are getting paid for them. 2 billion was not given to Jared out of the kindness of MBS’s heart. Putin didn’t want Trump to be President just because he liked him. He sold us out to the highest bidder.
YES! IT CERTAINLY DOES!!!
Trust me Trump is not doing it for free!
If he can monetize it he will spread it Anything. Absolutely anything. Even things that harm our nation He would monetize a fart if he could
It is truly GOBSMACKING in 2023 how the concept of "Copies" (electronic &amp; paper) never appears in vast rancor about classified documents.   An electronic copy (a digital file) can be attached to a million emails &amp; sent to a million different global recipients in minutes! THINK!
It's time DOJ. It's time.
Time for additional indictments, which now will totally do Trump in for life. Without question.
Was the aide arrested yet?
Was there ever any doubt? It’s about looting everything he can put the grab on. No exceptions! Lock him up!
I'm sorry to get so loud, but enough is enough: WHEN ARE Y'ALL GOING TO UNDERSTAND IT'S THEIR FAMILY BUSINESS?!
And why is he not in prison?
His lawyer's name is Trusty?  And Trump hired him?
$800+ Billion in Annual US defense spending to keep us safe…Republicans want to cut our earned Social Security &amp; Medicare to pay for it  &amp; Yet…”Trump’s legacy of corruption, 4 yrs &amp; 3,700+ conflicts of interest later”… Every damn day
I worked for the fed. To download any classified documents  To any than another federal laptop is a fed crime.  Or to any outside drive mechanism. Super serious  Especially if the person isn’t cleared security  big bad
I think it's pretty likely they are going to just blame
For 6 years
How convenient they come up with a laptop now.
Of course he was.
Kinda figured this would come out.
If only there was ever going to be any real accountability…
Just stop..
While we wait for action, he and his supporters are corrupting institutions, and creating chaos. I think many foreign actors are afraid of this blowing up and will do anything. He needed to be arrested in Jan 7
Does anyone doubt he has already sold secrets?
We all know he's a traitor. But they just love getting the American people upset to just watch Trump walk.
Plus there are still top secret documents missing
Russia N. Korea China Iran Saudi Arabia Did I overlook anyone?
About time for a search of all his properties.
Goes back to my previous statements:   How many Classified Documents were copied before FBI confiscated.
Umm ~~ espionage?  DOJ ‘Let’s review this ~~ for awhile’.
It means they are setting up the aid to take the fall for TFG.
Republicans Americas Death Panel
Yet Trump gets away with that too,and is allowed to run for President. He needs to copy more documents.
Which is why they are arms about Hunter’s lap top. If Hunter can do it and get away with it so can trump.
Much easier to prove with laptop in hand.
Because Trump worked for Russia who is allied with China and they told him to sign executive orders to cover it up from the media.  https://t.co/0sxTdTU7yg
The world knows that Biden is incompetent and he has put the nation in danger. Why else would we have UFO’s and Spy balloons suddenly appear.
That is why China sent the balloon to verify the info received from Trump and his allies.
I suppose Biden and Fauci deliberately spread Avian flu from the China balloon just to make everyone miserable!
Junior is now upset about a WaPo opinion column about eggs.
We are in a pandemic of Balloons Invasion from China!
We know about the China Spy Balloon but where did the other 2 objects come from? My guess China and or Russia
I thought the balloons being sent over from China were white?
How is this ‘fashion’???
We are in a pandemic of Balloons Invasion from China!
We are in a pandemic of Balloons Invasion from China!
We should restart the F-22 program
I think these balloons are a psychological warfare effort from China to put North Americans at a heightened level of fear of attack.
I ordered the take down of an unidentified object that violated Canadian airspace. shot down the object over the Yukon. Canadian and U.S. aircraft were scrambled, and a U.S. F-22 successfully fired at the object.
I spoke with President Biden this afternoon. Canadian Forces will now recover and analyze the wreckage of the object. Thank you to NORAD for keeping the watch over North America.
2/ ...Time will tell if the balloon was Chinese, but it is a pretty safe bet that it came from China considering the location of the balloon near Alaska, and the fact that neither the United States nor Canada nor any Western allies could identify it.
Another [Chinese] balloon was just shot down by the United States over Northern Canada.  "...the object was detected by NORAD and appeared to be a "high-altitude balloon."  "Trudeau said the object was shot down by an American fighter jet on his orders."
It wasn't a balloon.
Joe out looking for the latest balloon from China
This plane was flying in a residential area about 300 ft from roof tops for literally over an hour. WTH   Who was in that plane, and why?
We are in a pandemic of Balloons Invasion from China!
With leaders like Biden and Trudeau, it should be no surprise foreign adversaries are invading our skies.   Projecting weakness has consequences.
Well, surveillance balloons 🎈 from China and an impending war with Russia means you will need all the funding you can get
Um, three balloons from China flew all around US and fat orange guy did nothing
If an amateur photographer hasn't spotted the balloon in Montana, do we really think the Biden Administration would have done anything?   Almost certainly not. They would have let it go.
This China #spy #balloon stuff is so simplistic and obvious, I'm starting to think it's actually a Chinese diversion to take attention away from something else they are doing. 🤔 Either that or China are so broke they can no longer afford satellites anymore
US used $400K missle to shoot down Chinese ballon. Fired from a $216 million jet. If China or others keep launching cheaper balloons, it’s going to get expensive for the US.
Why balloons and objects trying to come in our airspace ?  From China I am sure !  Are we being invaded already ?
Being tested at this point I'm pretty sure to see how much crap we will take.
Correction: it was yesterday. But that doesn’t diminish her abhorrent behavior in any way. She was screaming and yelling at MILITARY OFFICIALS. She has no sense of civility or decorum and should be ashamed of herself. Read more below. https://t.co/6hmPJTqpCC
She's the poster child for the trailer park.
Oh and what would that be ? Are we shaming people for where they live ?  guess it's ok to shame the illegals for the shacks they come from or minorities from the ghettos they live in ...  I'm no fan of MTG , but your party is full of hypocrites . Knock it off.
Jesassss. Get down off your hogh horse, it makes your ass look big. The woman was in a briefing. That's a meeting where EXPERTS provide information to, not ask opinions of, other people. She acted like a child wanting attention and you know it. You talk about hypocrisy, and I  1/
Don't disagree. There is hypocrisy on both sides, but when all people like you want to do is throw out "whataboutisms" instead of just saying she acted like a dick, you're perpetuating the problem, so how's about you knock it off for a sec? K pumpkin?
Somebody has to scream and yell for Us, the hardworking Americans. We are being ignored and left out. Congress is supposed to Work for Us and you guys gals and whatever's need to remember that.
I thought less government was better. You folks should make up your minds. Why yell out to them if you want less of it to go around. 
Dude looks like a lady 
I thought you guys loved trans people ?
Ahh. Now I see it. I was wondering what direction you were coming from. I guess both directions. Did you complete your transition or just doing the hormones. Just wondering, sorry in advance if too personal.
I'm sure she had a very good reason for talking to the military in their native language! Shame on you.
Do you mean someone in that meeting leaked this information? should look into this accusation!
I thought you folks were all about transparency? And really? You think someone had to leak that? The woman acts like an unhinged banshee ALL the time, it isn't like it would be a stretch that her ape-like rant could possibly be heard from behind closed doors.
They probably needed it. They have been talking down to everyone about the China balloon.
Honestly, when was the last time you saw public decorum in our Congress?  Our prior speaker of the house totally embarrassed the US on TV  by ripping up the Pres speech in a hissy fit. I’m sure the  “behind closed doors” lack of decorum is even more common.
She hates her job. She stated that publicly. It's hard to scream non-stop and spread conspiracy theories and disinformation daily. And, she's just tired of people posting really bad photos of her. And, some people make true statements that are very hurtful. Poor Marj.
Her bad behavior has been reinforced. She, and people like her, confuse being contrary and aggressive with strength.  And she complains about being almost last? She’s a freaking junior rep…….. and a spoiled brat.
Howlers gonna howl.
Briefings are meant to give information. You can believe what you are told or not, but you can’t throw a tantrum to make the information different.
So this is how &amp; the treat the military- with blatant disrespect
I’ve noticed DeSantis and MTG have the same tone of voice.  Is that a N Florida accent or something?  Like nails on a chalkboard 
Your boss Madge is a total embarrassment to this Congress &amp; this country 
I can’t literally think of anyone who would be a worse choice for being in sensitive confidential briefings. You may as well just say secrets into a megaphone broadcasting into a satellite radio show. National security is going to be rocky during her tenure, to put it mildly.
And MTG yelling and screaming profanities in a classified meeting is helpful how?  Maybe that works in a family construction environment, but in high level professional situations, she's out of her league.
She needs to be held accountable, as they all do. They're emboldened now. Zero respect.
The thought that she is in classified briefings chills me to the bone.
If any of us did that at our jobs we would be walked out of the building and fired immediately.
I don't know how this isn't illegal. The people providing the briefing are doing their jobs &amp; in ANY workplace or work situation in America, cursing &amp; yelling at a fellow employee or subordinate would be fired AND could be sued.
When your being briefed by intelligence officials about issues pertaining to our country's security, don't yell and scream profanities at them and call them liars!!  Just because their briefing doesn't match your conspiracy theories doesn't mean it's lies!!!
#MarjorieTraitorGreene actually has no shame. This is the best her life has ever been, &amp; ever will be #MarjorieTaylorGreeneIsSoDumb &amp; #MarjorieIsIgnorantTrash she can’t conceive of how small she is, how laughable her actions &amp; behavior are
She's like the child that just needs attention, doesn't matter if it's positive or negative, she just needs the attention.
Sadly she chooses to display those behaviors James Carville described as  ‘real white trash.’
This broad requested a pardon, days after being sworn into office. She needs to be subpoenaed by the Federal Grand Jury, along with many others, indicted &amp; removed from her seat.
I wonder if she's in menopause? If so, she needs drugs or anti-depressants.
She shoukd have been thrown out of the meeting. Why wasn't she?
Were you personally there to witness said abhorrent behavior?!? I’m not saying it didn’t happen, but if you weren’t there, then all you have is hearsay.
What a disgusting person. Anyone who acts like she does shouldn't be on ANY committee in congress
She has no personal values
If we did this in our jobs we’d be fired.
Do they really have to stay and listen to her rants? This type of “interrogation” by a member of Congress should be called out. They should get up and leave stating they will return when the House Committee uses proper decorum.
And these same people wondering why young people are showing no respect for authority
MTG and any other of your members that acts that low are a reflection of you! Hope you’re happy!
I am completely disgusted that this woman has access to any kind of national secrets. She's a sophomore Congressman who had been kicked off her committees as a freshman because of her vile behavior. I blame you, You left our party to support THIS? #ShameOnYou
The rest of us would be fired for acting like her!
I guess you will be after Boebart next will same with GET over it !
is a disgrace &amp; national embarrassment
said he will never leave her. 
In a statement to The Hill, Greene was unapologetic for her behavior: “I had to wait in line the whole time. I was, I think, the second to last person, and I chewed them out just like the American people would’ve,” she said. “I tore ‘em to pieces.”
Her actions say much about her district voters.
Drunk? 
Hope you never hear how military people speak to each other, bro, you'll clutch your pearls so tight you choke yourself.  Like seriously, your problem with MTG is her lack of civility and decorum??? C'mon my guy, you are not a serious person. twitter.com/Victorshi2020/…
After the SOTU speech, here’s my surprised face. In other words, I’m shocked. Shocked.
she will get worse
You can dress "Sows" up but you can't teach them civility or manners ! They will still roll in the filthy mud !
Shouldn’t the military officers just tell her to talk in business like manners or they will close the meeting and continue without her   I would
Trash we are paying for.
I’d like to scream at some military officials and we’re retired military
Good. Unelected bureaucrats need to get reemed out daily. They should not have so much power.
Don’t hear you saying anything about AOC who yells and screams every time there is a camera pointing at her horse face.
vic , she was yelling at military officials that are trying to turn a once great military into the Y.M.C.A. everybody should be yelling at them , including YOU , unless you have already joined the club .
She is performing for MAGA extremists - that's how they all talk and think.
Jesus you people read the story what a joke
Dude you're pathetic and scared of women
There is so much trash in the GOP  the bad smell is encircling the halls of Congress
Nor does Gen Milley . My money on being more America First is with MTG
Seethe harder
It's difficult to shame someone who goes out on a limb to be seen and heard. AOC is no different.
You better hurry &amp; find a safe space
She’s the embarrassment????
Considering the rampant corruption of the government, im not concerned about some yelling and swear words. I also just watched members of the squad yelling, slamming things and crying last week. Its not like unbecoming behavior is something new.
MTG for VP
Good for her!  No one believes them.
Military officials should be use to being yelled at don't ya think 
Try going through a boot camp with those “military officials”. You think they were offended?  Only you are offended. Is it because a cuss word was used, did those words hurt your precious fragile feelings? Too bad
I guess you missed the news that our military blew up a vital gas pipeline belonging to the largest economy in Europe: Germany.  Would you congratulate them on this despicable act of sabotage against our ally? Mumble misgivings under your breath? Bow to their unholy power?
Or her passion is as strong as your BLM buddies ... who in fact actually behaved erratically... as opposed to "speaking" emotionally. By the way.... it's not even close on the severity!
The left has used this tactic the last few years, she was being loud and disruptive on purpose. To be the loudest in the room. Leftist tactics
I don’t want to stick up for MTG. Yet, if this was a closed door, classified meeting you probably can’t tell us *why* she was yelling and cussing. That’s a really important piece of information, no?
More balls than most of the men in DC
Oh no. Cower in a corner. Geez, grow a pair dude.
Boohoo cupcake join the military and you’ll see cursing is the norm
I know we shouldn't say things about people's looks, but why does her skin remind me of those modeling clay renderings used to identify skeletal remains?
She will never be ashamed of herself. She is proud of her trashy uncouth foul mouthed sleazy behavior. She has no conscience. Did they ever find out who planted those pipe bombs on January 6?
Such an embarrassment!!
Decorum is out the window at this point. Good for her.
Do you really think military officers have not had superiors/supervisors yell at them before? Military “officials” are not above supervision as our system of checks/balances
Great to know we have congressional oversight that is nit afraid to stand up to the other branches and departments that they oversee
&amp; so ugly.
Was she saying something like "don't stumble into WW3"?
if Trump were to pick her as VP i couldn't vote for him!!
Hey Vic, are you familiar with yellow journalism?   I'm glad she called them out. Sorry if it upset your tender sensibilities
WHITE. TRAAAASH!!!!
Yo, diversity pick, had you served in the Military, you'd have heard a lot of yelling, you'd follow our foreign policy more closely, understanding how Democrats undermine us. When all is said and done there's about a 90% chance you'd get your act together and become a Republican.
The spent a decade destroying shame, gerrymandering districts, and suppressing voters so she could act like a two year old and still be re-elected.
Oh and heckling the “PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES” during a traditional “State of the Union” speech!
And she will continue as long as the press makes a Huge Deal out of every word she says.  Stop quoting her. Stop covering her.  Then she'll shut up.
LOL………….You really don’t know what’s going on, do you?!?!?  #fighton
Haven’t you heard?
Love her!!!  Someone needs to call out these traitors.
Finally something we agree on
This is disgusting.  She is dealing with career officers, people who understand service.  This woman cannot conceive of duty, honor, or country before self.  She already violated her oath.  It is time she was gone.
Good for her!
You ever heard how people talk in the military?
Luckily we have someone that represents us, scream and yell if you have to this is America and it worth saving even if victor ahi doesn’t think so.
The military hearing profanity
She is taking this, I am a member of Congress, and you are not too far. She can not handle power or authority.
Not proof, I didn’t hear her say a word
Democrats are such hypocrites
Such a sad woman. I pity her to be so vile and angry all the time must be very taxing
I love that she is fighting and fighting loudly for Americans! We are getting screwed! We need someone loud! We need more people standing up for us like her. At this point being meek and mild mannered will get us no where. Be loud!
Fighting woke corruption demands an adhorrent behavior!  Amen
Embarrassment
Closed door huh, so who’s your fine upstanding leaker.
She probably wanted Jojo to stop the next balloon.
MTG and AOC: Twin sisters of different mothers.
When we judge people with low or no standards, they will always come up short. She can never be ashamed because she has no shame. Mr Santos/ish is another example. The question that needs to be addressed is how such shameless people find themselves in positions of power?
In my experience people who seek confrontation with our soldiers (who are professionals in human conflict and close combat) seldom come out top
MTG You go lady  Love You
Kinda like aoc
Give em hell #MTG! 
Love her principles and grit for America first. Winning 
Such an embarrassment to America, and Georgia in particular.
Abhorrent? No abhorrent is when there is a major problem from a simple issue and not knowing the difference. Up your game mister. Funny how restricted air can be on sondes by civilians huh?
Question: If it was a closed door meeting, how do you know this?  If leaked, the wouldn’t that mean that the military officials leaked it? if that is the case the larger concern is that those military personnel cannot be trusted with our national security.
And McCarthy sits by quietly… HE is the problem !
She's got that huge narcissistic know-it-all thing that her hero has and it's ugly.  I remember when congress-people were educated people with manners and civility.  Please, let's not let the bar drop this low.  Expel her.
She is communicating with targeted audience of voters that drive the electoral college votes &amp; vote in the gerrymandered districts that keep GOP in power-you &amp;others report her antics are amplifying/normalizing  this
I just can't believe she's divorced.
Are you a spy? It was behind closed doors..
I'd she had darker skin, there is zero chance you would be calling her out for behavior. Give me a break. Go sip some soy.
Tlaib, Omar, AOC.
She is trash and should never have Been elected or put on these committees
Who are you and why do we care what you have to say? And how can we verify anything you say? Are you just another leftist seeking attention and screwing over the Constitution?
Yeah, look at all this "civility and decorum":
If shouting prevents WW3 or a nuclear war, shout loudly!
Humm sounds a lot like AOC and Nancy
Is there a 25th ammendment for a congressperson who becomes mentally incapacitated during their term?
Like the saying goes, "you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig."
Man, if you can’t handle harsh words and raised voices, war is really going to be too much to handle. Is this really the state of the US military now? 
Someone has never seen Full Metal Jacket. She's speaking their language
How dare she stand up to the crap!
Její obličej zobrazuje povahu
Good for her
She's nothing compared to Maxine waters and AOC.
She has the mentality and hateful expressions of that of a white trash person because she is. No matter how much she tries to doll herself up it won’t cover up the ugliness she exudes.
Where's the sauce to backup your claim? Until tgen, this is here say
Well you said it, SHE HAS NO SENSE. There you go. That explains mtg
They work for her/us, they are not overlords, I would probably yell too if all they did was claim ignorance and not give the committee the information they are entitled to by our rules of government.
OK. The Military could not detect it so it must have teleported. They sent a flock of fighter jets to examine it but it was dark so they could not see what it was. The military is a joke and should be held to account!
This common decency?? Decorum?? I’d be fired if I behaved the way these cretins do.  She’s a cowardly bully.
She said “bullshit”? Oh my, I’ve never heard that word anywhere near military officials - ever.
She has seen little civil from you people on the left .She is an elected representative  and she gets her chance to represent her people like any other representative  does.Get over it !
Get your facts right before you post baby cakes
gives the term "white trash" a bad name.  And no, the American people would not scream and carry-on like a fool in front of the military.   Some of us were taught respect and manners.  was obviously raised in a barn.
Oh man she’s lucky someone doesn’t smack her upside her head. Which she clearly needed growing up and never got. Chick knows zero about the military &amp; should stay in her crazy lane.
Unhinged! Didn’t like being second last to ask questions!
If any of us displayed this behavior in a professional meeting, we would immediately be excused from the meeting, be placed on an action plan by HR, or FIRED. I am so dismayed by her sociopathic/narcissistic behavior.
They don't just operate at the id level of the brain, but the infantile id level where crying and screaming are the only forms of outward communication and information coming in is through an extremely narrow channel.
Has anyone checked her for a possible brain tumor?
She needs to be in a straight jacket with mouth duct taped shit!  Then placed in an asylum for life.  And not at tax payer cost!
Rawstory is a socialist rag, and you should not believe a word of it
Even if it was yesterday, you can bet she'll spout some more abhorrent BS today. WTF Georgia?
She got a lot of info for the first time that democrats act like are nothing because they don’t care about Americans. Good for her for being passionate. When AOC becomes unhinged, democrats love it. She became famous for being a social media star. Basically she’s a kardashian.Sad
You cant even get right day  you upper cased the military  I think the military won’t be snowflaked  into a complaint that they got feelings hurt and we’re in fear of their lives. Man up as they say.
...she is  awesome.  The military needs an ass chewing.
She's probably the most sane person in Congress. That's what scares you..
GOOD.     FOR.    HER.
Grow a pair
Hang on. I found some decorum for you. “Piss off weakling.”
All #WeakestSpeaker FAULT! He can't control his MAGAt caucus.
If she’s what Huckabee thinks is “normal” then I sure as hell choose “crazy” …
You're just mad because she has more balls than you do.
We heard Biden yell at the American people at the state of the union,,, name me one, name me one ….. Xanax must have worn off 
is a #disgrace
You must be on the CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINA payroll
Y’all were fine when they said, “some people did something”. Damn near cheered when they said,”get in their face, cause a crowd, and tell them they aren’t welcome here”. Didn’t bat an eye with, “we’re gonna impeach the Suck it up, buttercup.
And "The Squad"'s unhinged rants on the House floor are acceptable?
Did you look at AOC at the twitter hearings or for that matter any time the camera is rolling?  Ranting and raving and spewing lies about the NY Post not verifying the Hunter laptop. All members of the squad are off the wall malicious, unpatriotic a disgrace to our great country.
I love every second of it! Isn't she Great!!! She should have brought a bag of dog shit to throw at them!!!
You can't be nice to Marxists PERIOD!
Ohh you mean she didn’t start giggling like a little girl scared nervous and not knowing WTH to do… I’m sure came prepared and ready… not like a sheepish vp without a backbone who doesn’t even read her briefs and who can’t even keep women on her staff…
Similar to Trump. Even putting ideology to the side, Greene is not emotionally stable enough to be in a position of power.
Do you call out the democrats that act like savages?
Vicki, stop felching Biden for just one day, and recognize that MTG was elected to "share the stance &amp; opinions" of those she represents. SHE DID!  Little cucks like not liking it, makes it all the more effective. What is it with you Heterophobes ALWAYS being angry, "Vicky"?
At least she isn’t stealing other people’s luggage at airports 
You go girl
Fuck civility and decorum. I don't even care for the woman or any of the trash in D.C. they deserve no respect at this point
Irrational to you guys that don't think straight.
Hey, princess….. you ever have a spirited discussion with military officials? Ever wonder where the term “cuss like a sailor” came from? Grow up.
She should have absolutely no say in anything in country. leadership needs to take control of their genetically inferior simpleton racists
Miley and his woke leaders need a bit of screaming at. You go Majorie!
Sounds like hearsay n lies. U weren’t there. Where’s the proof n if she was they deserved it! Not too long ago AOC looked like she was on drugs at the podium, bouncing n yelling. Sick liars u guys are.
Oh the humanity! Military officials are after all famous for not raising their voice!
Fake News
i dont blame her, there all incompetent  and corrupt
She is a woman who won’t be held down. So is AOC and the Brother-Sister-Wife. Good for MTG calling them out. We have all heard far worse language and our military is in need of a good spring cleaning at the top. God bless her and protect her as she does the work for Americans.
Do you need your hand held?
She's scum,where is karma
You had the greatest National embarrassment with Afghanistan since Vietnam. Hey genius those military officials have caused the Ukraine invasion and embolden ChinA
She can't help what she does, just look at her face. Her face tells it all
You nasty vial mouthed people would scream, threaten physical violence, and outright disrespect a sitting president!! And not behind closed doors, but in a public forum for the world to see. There was NOTHING like it prior to any president including the American hating Obummers
Oh my, this is so much worse then when Democrats, Nancy Pelosi tore up president Trump's speech, or when media would constantly distract Trump for actually stating facts they didn't want us to know about
You are a Chinese spy.
They need yelling at!  Milley calling China! Losing Afghanistan! Targeting parents! The leaders should have resigned. But their without honor!
Everyone upset about a balloon from China yet strangely silent about the autonomous drone fleet from Canada that is spying on America...  Autonomous, self-organizing, able to operate in swarms, &amp; partially amphibious as well as airborne and ground-mobile.  The deep state at work. https://t.co/4hHRb03pO2
A good Elkhound acts as an area denial asset.
A good elkhound with a gun, you mean, right?
Nope, just the elkhound.
That seems unAmerican
Norwegian dogs often are.
The Wrath of Blakey.
I will be cancelling all high-level ministerial talks between Canada and West Atlantia
In your photo top left, it definitely looks to be flagging the troops in.  I have proof they invade rural areas yearly.  At the time I thought Blakey sent them as ambassadors.
You can never trust those sneaky Canadians
Yeah, that's not maple syrup &amp; poutine that they're dropping all over the place.
Dammit! I'm out of maple syrup and would love some poutine for lunch.
They are masters of disguise as well.
High tea camouflage - those must be headed to the UK
Good spot.
And they are definitely Hostile.
I've distrusted/disliked these bioweapons since they attacked LittlestApe at a pond many years ago. They then had the unmitigated evil gall to flap their wings and send a piece of poop covered down into my eye thereby giving me pinkeye.
Dropping biological hazards from a 1000 feet  is not ok. Time to wake up and go woke on them
Mike Pence refused to testify before the January 6th committee.  Now he has been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.  He should cooperate fully. Nothing prevents him from doing so - except his ambition to be president.  That must not override public interest. Not again.
We're still waiting for your incontrovertible evidence of Russian collusion.  #PencilneckDickhead
Seems a bit odd that you are chastising the VP given the fact that you lied repeatedly about your possession of documents that would prove Trump colluded with Russia.  How haven't you been expelled from Congress yet?
Zero truth to any of this… pahleeezzzz keep up
Keep up with what? Show your proof or gtfo.
 PROPAGANDA TWEET   Adam Bull Schiff misleading the American people to think VP Pence has to cooperate.  Can't make this Schiff up!
Your anger, hate, and lies will rot your soul and ruin your chances at salvation. You are an embarrassment to your family.
Feels good to hate, doesn't it? We can feel it oozing off you.
You first......
It is disgusting that Trump hasn’t faced criminal consequences for inciting a deadly insurrection against the United States.
He didn't. Oh ... Awwww ... How terribly disappointed  you must be.
Remember these words.  When yo are subpoenaed, we'll see what type of man you are.
All of you are walking talking advertisements for term limits.
Omg yes
Then he should do exactly the same as they did? Just blow it off? Now you’ll see that doesn’t sit well with anyone. But it was ok if it was the treasonous insurrectionist GOP?
WHO are you?
Yikes!  Schiff offering advice on how to follow the law...that's a new one.  Since "public interest" is so important to Schiff, we hope he follows his own advice when he gets subpoenaed.
Pathetic
How so?
When will Adam Schiff be investigated?
For what?
We can never again surrender the White House to a person who believes they’re above the law, or who prioritizes personal &amp; political interests above those of the people.  Never again. Never Mike Pence.
Yet you’re good with the liar that’s there now? 
Biden is a boy scout compared to Trump and YOU KNOW IT.
You should seek help 
Are you wetting your pants today Adam?
Ditto, should testify under oath.
Testify to whom? And about what?
You have more to worry about then misdirected attempts away from your blatent lies.
Well now that GOP has the house they will get additional videos &amp; emails before this one sided story continues. Remember this sir?
you’re a criminal.
Hey Schiff,  Your next, so we will see if your words will hold true to your ACTIONS !!!
Probably because it was an embarrassing sham. Evidence was ignored. You wasted good tax payer money for something no one watched.
When will you be testifying before congress UNDER OATH?
Do you say something or just fart from hour month again?
Hey Mike, do as we say, not as we do.  Got it? 
Why are you not disbarred for lying??
Has much as you lie, I wouldn't talk to you either!
I’m not trying to do anything… you seem very disturbed. I just feel sorry for you. Adam Shit lied before congress for over 6 years, and should be in prison. it’s not my fault you aren’t smart enough to see that. You are living proof of what HATE does to someone’s soul. Seek help
You keep telling yourself that. If you can hear it through the gate you are ingesting
I'm free to be wherever I choose. There's nothing you can do about it.
Why is such filth allowed on Twitter. Thought there was going to be more screening of tweets on Elon's (Republican shill) Twitter. Guess you won't see me on Twitter, anymore.
I agree… has zero reason to be allowed on  #garbage
Adam Schiff and “public interest” are polar opposites.
Something about that Cocaine it sure make you sniff a lot
When will Fed inciting Ray Epps get questioned?
Some more data on Ray.
Are you talking about Pence, or yourself? Sound an awful lot like something #adamschifty would say. The difference is Pence would be #honest
But what if Mother doesn’t let him? What if he gets down on bended knee and asks, “Mother, may I? May I respond to the subpoena, Mother?” And Mother snaps, “NO!11!1!12!!11! GO BACK TO RETICULATING MY BACK, LITTLE BOY!” Well, then what?
The committee is a political sham, dude.  It's not Mr. Pence who is inserting political gain into this nonsense.
Shifty where you been missed you! PS Zero people care about Jan 6th and even less people care about classified documents fyi
Why isn't lying Biden being put before a grand jury? his class docs he stole go back decades! the people are getting fed up with this unequal justice! "Equal justice under law" is engraved above the front entrance of the Supreme Court! there will be a price to pay!
Lol Listen to you!!!! Aren't you about to be charged with treason?
I’m pretty sure your subpoena to testify before Congress is coming too, Schiffty!
You should go be in jail for misleading the public
Don't worry, it'll be your turn soon.
Vengence is mine sayeth the speaker.
Good bye Adam. Irrelevance befits you nicely. Maybe some jail time for you in the future. We'll all watch together.
Heard your getting sued for the hunter  Biden laptop  classified docs humm we are rolling ip sleeves pencil neck
Great priority. That argument will probably convince a lot of people not to move out of California.
You should be in prison.
You &amp; should testify. Since all of you had the power to call in extra security and didn't.  Why?
Schiff is out, hard to leak info when you don’t get it anymore!
You lie &amp; kept things from the public, and you want people to actually believe anything you say no matter who it's about?
Standard Hotel
Mr Schiff I’m sure you have no ambitions either.
And, exactly why your witch hunt now extends to the very person who handed the keys to kingdom to the Traitor-in-Chief.
This is what
Exactly!!!
That's OK, been destroying these ass clowns. Can't handle the smoke.
He who?
I fixed it for you…
When are you going to jail?
Go away pencil neck
Pence is going to find out the hard way that man-made laws and public interest are more powerful than religion. No one is above the law.
Hope you go to jail
You must be SOOOOO disappointed.  You thought you had a sure thing there.
Adam Schiff is a liar.
Sir, your subpoena is on the way.
This is coming from the most dishonest congressman in Congress right now. Your comment on this matter is so politically motivated..
Shush
You are a good one to talk about ambition.
Thank goodness you’ve said something. Based on previous predictions from you, I feel confident this will be a giant nothing burger as it’s obvious it should be.  #Deception #LiesofCongress #AdamSchiffAlwaysWrong #LMAO 
AH LIAR.....
There is no “Pence wing” of the GOP.
We all are waiting for 45 to be prosecuted !
You abused your position &amp; let your personal political ambition override the public trust.
Why are seditionists allowed in Congress?
Shouldn't you be testifying about colluding with Twitter to get your opponents censored? 
You should be prosecuted for your treasonous attempt to unseat a duly elected president with bogus information
doesn’t think that Congress is entitled to his testimony, he said it on a TV interview. Pence owes the American people his testimony, they paid his salary while he played sycophant to Trump.  We want to know what happened, Pence isn’t electable if he can’t come clean.
how can he not testify? Does a subpoena mean anything? does that mean I can ignore subpoenas?
those subpoenas are a joke people show up IF they want to.
Mike Pence needs to make a decision..who is he more afraid of, Donald Trump or GOD. If he refuses to talk, then he is no Christian that I know and he must certainly think he’ll have to answer for this with his God.
I foresee numerous court cases, motions, and appeals up to SCOTUS before Mikey has to testify, which he’ll do by invoking 5A. It’ll take years, by which time Mikey will have lost bigly in the primaries. His political career ended, he and Mother will finally come out the closet.
I look forward to you being subpoenaed to testify for all the treasonous acts you've done! Let's see if you cooperate!!
Adam Schiff, per Twitter files, colluded with Twitter to interfere in a Presidential Election.   Fact.
You should totally take him down. He's one of yours the same way Ray Epps is one of you.
He's covering up something, like he knew all the details about the insurrection being organized. A "christian" man like Pence supporting Trump from the beginning is v strange, so there is much more 2 it. Russia hacking elections in Trump's favor was the tip of the iceberg
We're talking about Mike Pence here. The guy that "consults with God" to make a decision. The guy that believes in "pray away the gay". Oh, and he calls his wife, mother.
Uhhmmmm. . . I thought compliance for a DOJ subpoena was not a  "nah I'm not going to do that" kind of thing.   Refusal should entail going to jail. . . Shouldn't it?
What about you testifying to your lies about the Russia Hoax and sharing top secret information
Perhaps the fly will testify on his behalf…
So this is the latest gig, go after any GOP politicians who may want to run for President? Schifty’s smear campaign is alive &amp; well.
IF #MikePence Does NOT cooperate with subpoena, He has disqualified himself from any Federal Office..and Definitely Demonstrated He is Unfit for Office of the President of United States.
Leaker of classified info says what?
I'll never get over Mike Pence's longing gazes at Trump. He is disgusting and he will never be President.
Your subpoena is coming. I will enjoy watching you locked up for all the damage you have done to the American people
It’s been 2 years. What’s taking so long?  The republicans would have had this done by now. That’s why Dems lose votes. People want to see action and Dems contemplate too much.
You have no place in DC. You are corrupt as hell. So get out!!!
Let’s get you on the stand you Russia hoax liar
Why hasn't he been in DC jail for 2 years?? Because you helped Pelosi set J6 up! One last try to "get Trump" BLM protester caught on camera threatening to put police in the 'f---ing grave'
It seems you override anything you and fellow democrats do now doesn’t it!
Let’s see, if it goes against Pelosi and the dems! What will this giant list say then?
Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff allegedly leaked highly classified information so frequently that a former CIA director claims he was forced to limit how much information he gave to him and his staff.
Seems simple to me. He shows up and testifies or he goes to jail!!  That’s what would happen to me if I refuse a subpoena. If no one is above the law (jury is still out on that) truly, then that’s what will happen!!  The American people are tired of waiting for justice!!
So, you’re not happy Pence didn’t appear in your January 6 Infomercial? Maybe you can make up for it when you appear before a new congressional hearing about the Russiagate lying.
So let's talk about your classified leaks Sniff. We'll wait...
Pardoned felon, Paul Manafort, chose Pence to be Trump’s VP. Why? What is their connection?
Shifty at it again, just can't stop lieing
go away
Go directly to jail do not collect your leak classified info fee.
I really doubt he will. Shouldn't he be forced to or given jail time?!
Would be in the public’s interest that you be tried for treason
You shouldn’t have the right to say anything after you intentionally mislead the public over and over again! You are a liar and a hypocrite
Are you still hanging around?
Haha...that's rich coming from you!
Wasn’t he supposed to be lynched on J6? I thought he was your hero!  So what, now he’s just another insurrectionist???   Oh for God’s sake, give it up.
He should want to right a wrong . If not he should never be President.
I hope you have the same feeling when you get subpoenaed for all your criminal acts
I agree, he should testify
Mike Pence has about as much chance of being President as Adam Schiff has of being on the intelligence committee.
Let's get you under oath!
This should not override public interest.
Wait until all the liars in congress get their subpoenas?????
Schifferbrains...
Again, how can anyone that is running in public office especially to a high office be allowed to publicly refuse to comply with a subpoena issued by the court?? Hug, Mike??
When will the grand jury indict you, for lying from congress !!!
Just wait till they come after you to testify and hopefully the charge you with treason. Lying and interfering in an election should be a treasonous offense. You have been caught lying many times in congress. Get ready orange will be your new color
The eyes are the window to the soul, your eyes say it all! 
What!?  He wouldn’t testify before a sham “investigation”?  Wow.  Earth shattering.
You have zero credibility sir. I would find another career choice. You have disgraced yourself, your family and your country.
How your gay buddy Ed Buck?  Still getting pounded in prison. Bet he loves it.
Pencil neck.
How are you going to treat your subpoena?
When will you be forced to testify about all the fake evidence you made up?
You shouldn't be commenting on anything mister Schiff.  You should be in a jail cell for the lies that you told while collecting a federal salary.
can't wait till you get called over the phony bs you spewed
Leaker
and will hunter hand over all the information requested or will the fbi and doj??? stop with your crap he should use executive privilege like anyone on your side would stop with you stuff and still waiting on the Russia collusion in plain sight still??
You'd be better served, retaining your own counsel. Many, many axes are being ground for you. And rightfully so. America wants your tail in a crack and America will ultimately get your tail in a crack. You're toast.
Well I believe you are a very dishonest person, criminal, corrupt human being! When we elect President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho we will ALL BE SAVED!!! I GUESS! Because now we are in a time where ANYBODY that gets elected will be condemned! Idiocracy!!!!
Mike Pence refused to testify before the January 6th committee....That is because we literally have political prisoners in jail because YOU have manipulated the media to believe this was more than a simple protest that became violent! Not an insurrection!!!
Nobody lies more than you!
Nothing clever here just really dislike you.
Really, does anyone pay any attention to this guy Rep Adam Schiff the guy who earned the disgraceful reputation as the Primary Russian Gate, liar.
When will you be investigated?
are you going to say the same when you get your subpoena?
Your supercilious tweets amuse. Is your legal team and staff prepared to receive the weaponization subpoena?
Oh Adam… you’re next Sugar… you will be testifying… cross examined for all of your crimes…
Mr Trump was impeached by you for Jan6 and exonerated. Yet you attacked him again using taxpayers money!  Please tell us why?
Look shifty Schiff lying again!!!!
Thanks for your input.. now we know what not to believe.  
Adam, I wouldn't be surprised if a few subpoenas came your way as well..............Make sure you don't override the public interest!
And so should Obama but he’s not. Why are you not complains about that?
Who put a quarter in your slot? I’m sure they’ll figure it out.
Can't wait until you are indicted. Tick tock pencil neck.
The J6 clown show is over. Payback time.
Does the Trumpican cult have to mix paint chips into the kool-aid or is that reserved for the exceptionally intellectually challenged?
can i has president next?
You belong in jail for treason
You should probably not say anything. You are known by everyone as the biggest liar in Congress… and there are A LOT of liars in congress.
You and  make a perfect pair....lies, lies and more lies... Wait until you are subpoenaed....bet you will not show up
Maybe he will roll on you. Pencil neck.
You lied to the American people. YOU should be stripped of your committee assignments……. Oh wait #fired #pencilneck #crazyeyes
You lied about sources who would have “damned 46”. You leaked government secrets in hopes to secure yours and your master’s secrets (at the expense of tax payers). Find a hole and lay face first into it, Österreich.
Is there video of President Trump inciting the Jan 6 incident or any video of Pelosi setting it up? When did the Dems hire Epp’s?
You have the most punchable face ever...
You need to be in jail Adam
OMG. The biggest liar in the USA and you have the nerve to talk trash about Pence?  Your sorry ass is going to be in prison after the House investigations.  The HONEST ones.
U still touchin the kids again
I wouldn't have gotten anywhere near you Stalinist committee, let alone testified.  How many tax dollars did you waste on that garbage?
Schifty Schiff still trying to be relevant.  
You are the biggest liar ever to serve in Congress.  Just shut up and go away! Your lies had real, harmful consequences.
Of all the necks on the line the one you should worry about most is your own.  You are an expert at political suicide so stop trying to pull everyone down with you.
It's  nothing new that a giant #Balloon floated into  other country's airspace. #China witnessed a few from the #US and other countries before. But we treated those incidences in a low profile and through communication. What the US did this time is really odd and abnormal.
#svengoolie  Wait a minute!  Are we sure all those balloons flying over recently are from China?  🤔 https://t.co/kndwsynnEs
#Svengoolie UFOs.
This is an A+ tweet!
A 3rd UFO in as many days was just shot down over Lake Huron. My sources say these aren't ET craft, but  Deep State drones being used in a psyop. Is it to blame China to start a war, distract public from Ukraine, prevent ET disclosure, or all the above?  https://t.co/AUxPV9TV4i
Absolutely Dr Salla
Free earth alliance!!!!
Drones at 20 to 40,000 ft ?
2 Air force planes monitoring Lake Huron and Lake Michigan right now. Your right!! It’s not ET craft. Possibly project blue beam.
   Gotta love it
Since #UFO Twitter is lit this morning, it’s a good time for a poll. Which gets people more excited?
Another psyop ... 
'China is jumping in on the trend, apparently, as authorities in China say they have spotted and are tracking an unidentified object over waters near the port city of Qingdao'
you have the credibility of lint Salla. Stop pumping up the fear porn
“my sources”
Source: Trust me
until when will the white hats allow all the cabal's maneuvers?.
Or merely to usher in more authoritarian policy under the guise of national security?
birthday balloons interfere with human politics, weird
Cool sources.
Apparently the object shot down over Lake Huron was octagonal in shape
It's the fault of those who armed Taiwan and Ukraine, the only country to use nuclear weapons.....
It's so they have something to blame when the fit hits the shan for the Ohio train derailment debacle
The False Flag Von Braun warned us about. Suggestion: Dr. Greer book the Press Club for an emergency session!
Exactly
Something fishy.
My sources say the same. Thanks Dr Salla for staying on top of this.
I'd question those sources a bit more. What I'm hearing is these guys "phoned home". Watch for the anvil-shaped clouds. Remember this tweet. ~HAL
Distraction from the all the hearings.
To start a war with China?! The USA lost against Vietnam, imagine what would happen against China!!
These are spy satellites/tech, NOT aliens.
I say all of the above.
Funny it all starts after trump completes his treason by selling class. dox.
I've noticed that when interest in the UFO/ET subject is peaking, a war is never far behind to divert our attention.
We're here to see if there is one iota of truth concerning deep States or better still alien surveillance drones.
This Deep State psyop narrative is really building up steam - in the tinfoil hat brigade.
The USA has no money for war
It's half-assed, whatever it is...
Any Schumer sighting is far more unnerving...
I know this much.. don't believe a single word Schumer says..
So now it’s a damn ufo? How much more creative can they get with this damn ballon 
I think these are 'staged events' to save face from the Chinese Spy Balloon fiasco. Although they're quick to say "Unidentified Objects", they're loath to say "Unidentified Flying Objects" even though these objects are "Flying" at 40,000 feet. The next excuse will be -
Distraction.       Look at the .    .    Don’t question new policy...  sending “offensive weapons “ to Ukraine  .  What does a defeated Russia  do in the aftermath?  .  What does a chess ♟ champion do when he sees he sees his defeat??
A DEEP STATE DRONE JUST FLEW OVER MY HOUSE
Blame China then drag #Australia into it…  #GoodByeAustralia
Wtf would we want a war w China?!
Simple. It's to give Biden an opputunity to act quickly/ decisively in order to appear like a competent Commander in Chief. The admin cooked this whole thing up. The timing in terms of the appearance of these things RIGHT after the Chinese balloon worldwide humiliation  - uh no.
They are just trying to get to the super bowl.. Give those poor UFO's a chance
It's obvious they aren't ET, ET have been in earth's airspace for many years &amp; all of a sudden they're shooting them down!?! GTFOH, they need to do better. can see the deception. They're no match for ET and they know it. Ask
It is another propaganda of theirs to scare the crap out of people and cause calamity.
Ahh, The Greer angle which is also a psyop of its own because he wants everyone to believe ET will cure cancer and keep the lights on for free.
The extraterrestrials watching us must think how dumb can they be? So easily distracted and put on another path.
Lord Jesus this is crazy bat shit stuff-!! We couldn’t make this up if we tried /!!
Most likely all the above; but they know disclosure is coming, as per Elena Danaan's message from Thor Han.  We know we do not have the tech to shoot down a real ship from the Galactic Federation of Worlds. So more scare crap from THE LOSERS.
The fake alien invasion propaganda is their last card to try to get hold of the narrative before their system implodes on itself. It means they are desperate to get our attention "look here, not there". Major distraction psyop
No UFO invasion. Just more Chinese balloons they are called UFO to keep people from getting wound up about China.
Actually they are UFO until they become IFO.
I don’t see how that would make things better
Actually UFO is the proper terminology until they're identified.
Winding people up about China is one of the Pentagon's favorite pastimes, that is one of the last things they would avoid doing lmao
The pentagon has said these are not balloons.
Yeah cause UFO's help people relax
👋 Can someone tell Biden that it’s time to Ban China from buying American land 💯🇺🇸💯🇺🇸💯🇺🇸💯 we must signal to China that its new line of behavior is unacceptable. flying spy balloons Ofer our land !!?,  Next  China will build spy  station on American land owned by  China 🇨🇳 https://t.co/fNjmOb6ZYI
 last time I checked for Americans or any foreigners to buy a land in China is really hassle and I don’t think they allow you to buy more than one land   American foreign policies are good for the foreigners and bad for us
tell, ask, plea with byeyouredone china biden?!  now, that's a good one. I haven't laugh as hard in weeks as I have today. Thank you
 my tweet was not funny  It’s sad to see what’s happening to our country
He’s been brokering deals with China for years, that’s why General Motors is primarily owned by the Chinese!!!!
They already have police stations
I say these unidentified flying balloons are from China or Russia!  Agree?
I can’t say but another one was just reported in MT. (a few ago) Senator Tester (MT) just put out a tweet.
That’s what my son says
North Korea?
They have been getting cozy lately.
Re: Object brought down in #Yukon. Based on info from the Canadian Defence Minister I used hysplit to track backward upstream. Once again I get a track that crosses #China 5 to 7 days ago. This is using the altitude at shoot down. Would vary at other altitudes. #ChinaBalloon https://t.co/2rzGJYLte8
Nope, it's multidimensional NAZI's hiding in the Czech Republic...
Get used to looking at the world from a different view.
From the Guardian Newspaper 2019  
So, you think China(or whoever) launched a series of  balloons or whatever they are, in our direction and they're just arriving one by one? There was an ignored bit of news last week about them launching balloons all over the place recently, not just over the US, but everywhere.
This is scarier than aliens.....
#thread #气球
So will all scientific balloons be called spy balloons by the US? The US believe that others will do what the US have done.
Dan, the winds/origin are pretty much the same for any object that ends up in that area. It’s not like this is anything definitive.
Not always. It would vary quite a bit and also by altitude. Russia more often I would suspect.
The USAF either shot down the 12Z weather balloon from Kotzebue or (bear with me here), they shot down a little tiny spaceship from the Planet Smallrocksia. I'm seriously leaning towards our weather balloon. And it's pretty well supported with the balloon optimization Hysplit.
#BREAKING : Now unidentified flying object (UFO) spotted in the sky of #Uruguay. Uruguayan Airforce is investigating the matter.  What is happening in this world? Are these events from USA to Uruguay, Canada to China are related to alien 👽 or just Chinese spy balloons ? https://t.co/5kPG2j1JoI
According to senator chuck shumer 1st two were balloons
They have not found the debris yet
Why such things happen at night?
Chinese prank    .. They are making fun of supaar powaar.   
Distraction with a fake alien narrative
Aliens
Kejriwal on global tour 
Hope we are not invaded by alians
US army ready
Starlink
Fooling the word ..it another object from area51.
Car headlights all day long.
NOthing in Europe. No one cares about Europe anymore. 
What ever that is why would you put a great big light on your spy balloon lol
There was a tweet that a new type of UVA was seen over Ukraine as well.....not sure if related.
UFO is literally unidentified flying object, nothing to do with aliens.
I guess the new cover name now for any UFOs is they are 'weather balloons'...Previously, whenever there would be any single or multiple UFO sightings, even those witnessed by many people, the governments have been famous for calling these UFOs 'light flares'...
One more incidence of UFO sighting. Your predictions are coming true if indeed this was UFO.
Aliens are here to get our mind off high inflation and debt crisis. Perfect timing. We love you aliens.
Baba venga Predicted Aliens will Attack EARTH
If it was aliens who are travelling inter or infra galactic they will be capable enough to avoid F22 , its china for sure
This is most strange and peculiar ! Why there is no information for this strange occurance happening randomly accross the world ? I don't believe in the alien theory but then why, how ? Who is behind this ?
Ghanta kuch samajh araha   Bas at kale laga rahe baba ji
#China is neither denying nor accepting.  Creating confusion among all.
Distraction from 1-Fake covid expose, 2-Insider job to trigger Russia war,3 - Epstein files release, 4-Ohio chemical disaster,5 Manipulating people with fake news so they don't look at real issues.
Alien is just imagination
Maybe this is a rehearsal of war using satellites.
It seems like turning, most probably some small aircraft with Landing light on, so when it face the camera, it is visible and when turn right side, it goes out of sight. This is just an thought.
dont dare shot at this configuration. if you do they not only know you are about to shoot. but they also can speed away in fraction of a second!!! or they can send a blue beam at you!!! that blue beam will dissolve you and your friends around you!
Fallen angels of satan
Looks like starlink satellite train seen through a gap in the clouds.
colocam um foco pro povo, para esconderem outras coisas
bruh you cant be serious taking footage like this &amp; calling it a UFO sighting hahaha fuck me
BIDEN and his cronies got lost in space
All of these superpower gang up against America so they can contain them maybe that's the only way of preventing a nuclear holocaust...America is out of control...
Nope None of the above All this shit is created by the US government to take attention away from the real problem Biden. Focus the attention on some other country or some other person. They just want to divert the attention away from the problem the corrupt US government.
Distraction from bigger threat. May be new virus being planted by US-China-Deep State- Pharma Mafia Alliance.
This handle is the biggest conspiracy theorist. Peddling bullshit about PoK since past 3 years and pretending to have some “deep sources”. Even caused problem for our IA Northern Commander.
They want us to believe it's Aliens or China. Both fit the narrative. They want a new scaremongering tool and eventually war with China. There was English text on the first balloon so makes you wonder. And the Pentagon recently got an OK for these sort of ballons. Hhhmmmm.
Project Blue Beam and their fake alien agenda soon coming.
So this is some sort of distraction. These are balloons that map geography for map programs like google maps or China's version known as Amap. Jets are following the balloons which is why you continue to see tankers take off to refuel them. Theatre from the clowns in the…
Ok already.  What in the hell is going on?
These new ones aren't balloons apparently.
This goes beyond the White House.  Or beyond the Democrat/Republican paradigm used to keep us fighting each other.  They are gearing up for something very big here.  Whether it be an alien invasion, or World War 3.  It is definitely one of the two.
But but but hey everyone look at those balloons were those flying objects that are coming from China. #Psyop #HunterBiden #ClassifiedDocuments 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/6iK6UAnZyW
China has spy SATELLITES. Balloons are relatively useless in comparison.
Why did you let the Chinese spy balloon fly over thousands of miles of Canadian airspace?
We don't know they are Chinese Spy Balloons first off , second they do seem to be dealing with whatever they are and taking them down . This is where all the BS misinformation &amp; rumors start we shouldn't jump to conclusions. I don't mean to say you aren't correct but patience
Yeah but so do we ! anybody paying attention the last 6 years knows this . There were 2 reports released from the Pentagon very clearly stating that they track balloons all the time , 1st report said 144 unknowns reported, 2nd report over 500 reported . These objects aren't the
Typical UAPs that military witnesses have seen , those objects have technology that seems otherworldly they can shoot up into space and just as quickly shoot down into the water as far as we know that technology hasn't been developed yet it's concerning.
Keep in mind they spy many different ways , through social media for one , but we spy too  our military would never be able to take down a legit UFO they are just way to advanced. These are man made and could be Lockheed Martin or one of those private companies
Balloons closer to the surface… higher resolution imaging, greater intelligence.
Balloons are closer to the service for higher resolution… increased intelligence.
Spy satellites have a resolution of less than 10cm.   They could see a shadow of a man taking a piss in a field.   How much hi-res camera gear (basically a telescope) and comms equipment can possibly on a balloon?   I declare shenanigans.
If the balloon is the size of three school buses… lots. And, their are other types of radiometric data that can be better acquired when it has less atmosphere to travel through.
Lots of people are asking if there is a relationship between the spy balloons from China and instances of Chinese spies at Mar a Lago. https://t.co/8ls4nJEn9k
Chi-Gate! Scary! Oh boy!
Why not? Let's get this going~!
Don’t let the China spy balloons distract you from the fact that LeBron James has lost 6 NBA Finals #LBJ #spyballoon #ChinaSpyBalloon #LakeShow #LeBronJames https://t.co/w5IIrszYJ9
Yeah okay also been to the final 10 times more then MJ can say
Queen James
Would u rather not make the playoffs or lose in the finals?
Lose in finals 
I wish my favorite player could even make the playoffs
The original spy balloon didn't come from China https://t.co/2dgQ9ahtPS
Could balloons shot down from China be testing for friends N. Korea, checking our military interception capabilities. N. Korea's missile &amp; nuclear abilities represent a security challenge. Any major instability could have severe strategic, economic &amp; humanitarian repercussions. https://t.co/pnOh50pVDR
Something is going on, but we’re not going to find out for a while. Rest assured, if it calls for any real decisions from Joe, he’ll make the wrong ones just like he always does.
I completely agree. We have the wrong President to have our country come first.
They likely spread a new deadly virus, no need to invade us yet, just wait until most of us are dead.
Some enjoy the immediate ego rush.
They got a brilliant reaction from the china spy balloon 🤣🤣 so time for some more
China balloon. Alaska UFO. Canada UFO. China UFO. Uruguay, lights in the sky.  (Now I'm aware of the 2nd china balloon they claimed to have come up from the south During the first incident)  However, whatever is going on, the government seems to be trying to have us look up. https://t.co/3qMnb3RaMq
Dry run lube job
What do we need from China that we're not capable of producing or have produced in the past?? Sanctions should be rolled out!! I don't believe for a jack minute we're shooting down harmless, cotton-picking Weather Balloons!! https://t.co/zIx6SbltgN
I'm with you girl.  So for now they're highly evolved extraterrestrials seeding the human race with happy feelings and increased intellect.
Right now, not everyone is smiling!!
I know. Sorry. A good therapist would say I'm using wishful thinking and humor as coping mechanisms.
uh...no
In one week, The #USA went from allowing an actual #ChineseSpyBalloon from observing every military base we have to “SHOOTING” down invisible balloons, UFO’s, blips, bleeps, and blops! Interestingly..NO COUNTRY has CARED???? #SeemsSuspucious #Media #ufotwitter #nopeep #china https://t.co/kvA8InLaEt
The US has pretty much sealed off China from the Pacific. From Japan to Indonesia. But it only took Chinese balloons to get to the US mainland. Simple, cheap, effective. Lol.
Taranta mga hitad sa lobo 
(2018) Images surfaced of China testing hypersonic glide vehicles dropped from high-altitude balloons. Is this what the military has been seeing over the past few weeks?   The balloon's payload adapter was carrying three glide vehicles which would fit the https://t.co/7nKurY9ZGa… https://t.co/tUJMbys8Ld
That description would imply that the payload is suspended 30-40,000 feet below the balloon. That’s roughly 7-8 miles
I meant the ‘objects’ have been spotted gliding at 30-40k’ while the balloons were spotted at 60-80k
What are glide vehicles?
Vehicles dropped from high altitudes which do not have typical jet propulsion engines, and can be used as reconnaissance drones.
or payload delivery...
explosive payloads
No bueno if it is …. Wow interesting find
Saw this a few times but they are doing a good job Suppressing it.
Opinion? Personally I hope we've hardened the grid knowing for the last 50+ years what an EMP is capable of...
There could be drones on there which could take out a target like missile silo. The sky’s the limit what they could have done.
they dont look like hypersonic glide, and why on earth they'd send it by balloons, hypersonic planes can fly over north america undetected, or detected long after they're gone
There is a possibility that readiness is being evaluated.
Flying squid
sounds about right
Plausible
Looking forward to annihilation.
what a great question??
Testing it over US and Canada doesnt make sense.  China supposedly said it was a weather monitoring balloon that flew off course… doesnt add up.
Perfect EMP delivery method
Get yourself a ham radio
Looks like China was sending us a message about our National Security. Meanwhile, our government wants to disarm the nation's citizens right to bear arms. Hmmm...
This seems like a plausible explanation.
Not real. Look at shadows.Fake news
Doesn't look friendly to me
I’m from the village of “wish ya woods”…we ain’t scared, drop down east side of Detroit…I dare you…lmao
have you seen the “missiles” they developed around 7 years ago, that “glide” ? Allowing them to turn at 180 degrees ? They were in a “parade” they had; &amp; commentators were talking about how the gliding provided a “low altitude capability”.
They look like warheads, with wings, dropped from height, they could glide to their intended target, and the wouldn't necessarily need propulsion.
Ty for this.  This actually makes sense.  So the hypo is that these “balloons” are either empty trial run delivery vehicles or they’re the real thing?
I’m sure the Chinese have high quality satellites orbiting that they could use to spy on the U.S??
Getting ready to lose power, internet etc. Coming soon.
Yeah that's what I was warning ppl about it's WW2 technology also a nuke detonating in high atmosphere creates a very powerful EMP
I'm just waiting for the government to say somehow the Epstein papers and Hunters laptop were on that balloon we shot down. Oops guess the topic is over now!
The Twitter thread sourced in the article is from 2018, even I would imagine they've finished "testing" them by now and, most likely, now spell "vehicle" as MISSILE
China needs to be removed from anywhere in the US.  All lands confiscated.  It’s bad enough that we have to really search for products not made there including materials.
Independent news advertising balloon like the Goodyear Blimp...
I wouldn’t doubt it.  They never would of tried this sh*t when Trump was POTUS.
Why would you think they are from China ? Do the Chinese write Chinese on their newest Secret weapons 
Do you think WWIII is on the Horizon?
U.S. government: "We want war, we want war!"  Don't fight their war.
all these UFO sightings aren't aliens at all, they're just unused "Its a Girl!" gender reveal balloons from China looking for a new home
That’s a good one.      Is what the doctor says when you have a boy in China .
Just like Covid, The Balloons 🎈 come from China 🇨🇳...Once Again Canada and our government is covering for their CCP overlords..
The US spends £900B a year on defence-   China sends it into a spin with half a dozen $3 balloons from Wish 🤷🏻‍♂️
The rePUBLIC of the United States should not be confused.  The shutdown balloon from China, including the shutdown above Alaska, above Canada and now hovering above Montana are all coming from China!! https://t.co/laKMayq9bG

They are not balloons from China, then?
Bolsheviks discussing exterminating Americans. Many Libertarians, Bolshie Republicans and alt-right traitors celebrate this scum in the name of "fighting Communism". Stalin &amp; Genghis Khan are their role models. China balloon was intentional diversion from Russian offensive.
Where are these balloons being launched from?  China is very far.   A ship in international waters?  Arctic?
Satan sponsored spy balloon spotted over China appears to have floated all the way from Hollywood in America.  https://t.co/D5k8IMCOKF
Time to log off
The industry is now officially a joke 
They went from China Spy balloon to UFO's awful quick. What are they hiding? A LOT !
I believe the story of the spy balloon from china is nothing but a lie to manufacture support for war on China. This will trigger a WWlll.
Russia they thought would be  push over with NATO now they dare not start  a 2nd front  China &amp; Russia will wipe them out for sure even as far as USA
#BREAKING : Reportedly Chinese Airforce shot down an unidentified flying object above #Rizhao area of China just while ago.  Look like Chinese are downing own spy object to make world fool &amp; diverting attention of world from Chinese spying balloons flying over multiple countries.
Both are untrustworthy countries. Both don't care about sovereignty of others.
Must be some Rouge element in PLA that is beyond CCP control...
US jet shoots down ‘unidentified object’ over northern Canada, Trudeau says https://t.co/GjWNLtGA1K
NORAD? Santa? 
I think it’s best that no one goes skydiving over North America right now.
I really doubt a ufo would let something shoot it down
What is it?!!! Why the coverup?
Never a more appropriate time for the Abe meme
Much more focus on balloons than toxic railroad fires it seems
Why is the US Air Force patrolling Canadian airspace?
Imagine if these turn out to be of alien origin and signals a pending invasion.    Suddenly we’d be patching up our relations with Russia and China as we’d be collaborating to save humanity.
I guess Trudeau is now the US’ 2nd black president.
What was it? Another Chinese weather balloon? alien space ship?
What you say now gop?
"So how did most of humanity come to be annihilated by the aliens?"  "Bad luck. The aliens sent a friendly welcome craft to eath but unfortunately it was the week after this Chinese spy balloon incident and, well..."
"No propulsion system..."  wtf   ..
it’s all happening!! 
Better to watch Killer Klowns on Svengoolie than the News! Give it a break!
I am stressed out what the eff is happing
Might wanna check the US weather ballon inventory... I think you'll find 2 missing.
What is going on? So bizarre.
Relax, it’s probably nothing.
Notice Canadian jets couldn’t get off the ground
"Trudeau approved shooting down Santa. The war on Christmas has begun"    - Tuckems on Monday
Is everybody deliberately trying to make this sound so strange? What I’m hearing sounds really off. #UFO #norad #shotdown #Aliens #ChinaBalloon
So the U S shot down something over Canada where was the Canadian air force
The "unidentified object" shot down over Northern Canada.
Let's see how curious you get now, Jake.
Can you help share this Sir ? Many need help
So it’s ok to do it over land now?
Do we have to shoot them down over other countries too?
REPORT: Iran stockpiling massive UFO arsenal just 2 stress out U.S. Intelligence ...
Taliban, Russia, China, aliens...everybody is taking advantage of Joe Biden's weakness.
Americans always have two schools of thought.  1. Who is/are the adversary nations? Why do they do this? 2. Why does Biden do this to America? See how intelligent Americans are.
A genius alien race comes to save human life from its self-inflicted demise. We shoot them down.   Sounds on point for us.
Wait, they have no idea what they shot down? And our cracker jack journalists at CNN are buying it? Jesus age Christ Was up Jake! Do your job!
As a Canadian I am so embarrassed that Canada could not shoot down the balloon with our own planes…. Dear USA please invade us I promise it will take less than a day.
It’s important to note that Canada PM asked for shoot down! Biden would have happily let it collect data as it floated over the continent!
Wow, one of our $210 million fighter Jets engaged a weather balloon and won! So proud!
Biden is so incompetent he's declared war on the wrong aliens.  Obama was right about Joe...  “Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to fuck things up.”&nbsp; - Barack Obama
First came the Monkeypox. Then now the Space Invaders. Where’s Pac-Man?
What about Congress voting on their own term limits, audits, salaries, lobbyist regulations to favor their too big to fail mega donors? What about Operation Mockingbird/Ministry of Truth? What about the corruption of the fractional reserve banking scheme?
#China detects #UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) in waters near Rizhao city, Shandong province &amp; is preparing to shoot it down: Chinese media  This could be a #Chinese attempt to deflect from the balloons in the #US, like: "It's happening to us too", or "we shotdown a US balloon" https://t.co/jRpLTZk0Yo
China actually shot down a UFO.  According to the Chinese it is very tasty!!!
Never trust the market moment and never trust the Chinese.   Both are good at beguiling and deception.
"The Aliens are coming"  CT : "so buy bitcoin?"
The new game in town : who can shoot the most enemy surveillance vehicles
I assume China is saying they are ready for war and by their calculus, they have a good chance at winning. They’ve also checked history from the II WW and are confident to proceed. We shall see!
Finally a common ennemy like the one Ronald Reagen ever wished for.
Ofc it's deflection
Pathetic CCP
Jimo: Calling Rizhao checkpoint. Any photos from the scene ready? It has been few hours and the world needs a follow up. Over.  Rizhao: Roger Jimo. MFA was cross-checking our pops. They found few items misspelled USA, and some used Chinese to write Made in USA. We are fixing…
Let the games begin. Conspiracy theorists are all over this now. I wonder how many other countries spy on each other and how many get caught spying.
How can you be sure it's not an alien?
Manananggal lang yan, courtesy of the Republic of the Philippines.
Kaiju spotted yet?
Nah I think Americans were spying on Chinese, Chinese did a quid pro quo , Americans didn’t want to shoot that ballon as it would affect their operations in South China Sea
Their worst fear. Lol. Knew we could turn the lefts hate around and put their balloon into a positive.
One of their own. lol.
Mothership is on the way and the aliens are not happy.
Just target practice for the CVP.
The US has set an example of recklessly shooting down "unidentified" objects trespassing. Guess who needs to be more careful henceforth.
I was in Hong Kong during the melamine milk scandal. The CCP papers were quick to publish lists of harmful foreign foods that were stopped by Chines customs inspectors: clearly made up brands that didn’t exist. So I’m not at all surprised that they also just found a ballon.
This whole thing could be a Chinese diversion attempt. It is so easy to fake
either that or it is an alien craft
I don't get this, how can it be a UFO "in waters" that would be a USO, unidentified submersible object. Over waters I would understand.
 ping pong panda  propaganda 
Does this open the door for the possibility that some of these UFOs are North Korean and not Chinese maybe?
Anything is possible at this point, we need more info.
because western media isn't deflecting nothing , right?
The CCP has lost face when their fig-leaf lie was exposed - intel gathering instead of weather data....so they have to resort to this tit for tat game
Ugly ccp
Hey everybody look over here, while we’re doing some really messed up shit over here we don’t want you to see
Joel 3:9-10 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
 My guess is we are at the tit for tat portion of this escalation and rather then cause panic on our side anyways () they are just letting civilians run with their imagination no need to cause unnecessary panic as they say.
…they have the mentality of immature belligerent teenagers!? #pathetic #transparent
The more you become selfless the more you find yourself.
 Miles Guo’s Latest Revelation On Feb. 7th, 2023 (Eng. Dubbing):  Strictly speaking, the CCP’s sending the spy air balloon to America this time is a declaration of war. This is the true “shadow war,” an asymmetrical war, and this is the true unrestricted warfare.
They’re just distracting you from all the massive failures of this administration.  And/or trying to over compensate for the mishandling of the China balloon.
Tell them it was swamp gas and a balloon from China
Shit how do I delete a tweet? #UAPTwitter #ufotwitter #UFOs
Do United States has now just shut down the fourth balloon allegedly from China and the president has not spoke to the nation ? Beijing Biden is truly https://t.co/eDOMFY9ZQT
No one said the others are balloons though lol! They’re being called “objects” because they have no idea what they are. Balloons don’t stay afloat after being shot like all these are only the 1st was a balloon. But yes Joe is in deep with China
Totally.  https://t.co/VhEpNRF9Iz
Chinese Communist Party trying all the way to clean up Americans from American land. China sent engineered SARS, China sent fentanyl, China sent spy balloons, China sent 60,000 spies into USA through southern border and planning to send 250,000 spies to USA. Our 10% Guy Biden… https://t.co/q5ubA1OUkq
if means that the only way they can distract from the china balloon they failed on, is to saturate the news with "other incidents" that never really happened.
Three mysterious “objects” have flown over North American airspace in the past 24 hours. Two have been shot down and the third will be shot down Sunday morning.   What does this all mean?
Japanese #balloon bombs from the 40s. Used during #WWII. Wonder if this is where China got the idea? 🤔  #Ukraine️ #akaworldwide #norad #Montana https://t.co/JExgN4Uo4o
That was a fine bit of sleuthing. We analyzed the sand in the ballast to find &amp; bomb the factory.
That’s not where they got the idea These balloons have been around for ages Nothing new or special
Yikes I just learned about these in the book - The Mosquito Bowl. Great read, and I don’t even like football.
Hostile and genocidal enemy back then. Hostile and genocidal enemy now. As simple as that. 
Research Chinese test hypersonic missile 2018
Yeah, no one had ever heard of balloons until then.
We are totally popping viruses all over the place
japan used some of these balloons to commit biological warfare across many regions of china. they infected fleas with bubonic plague, put them in ceramic containers &amp; dropped them from planes &amp; balloons. unit 731, the perpetrators were granted amnesty by the us for their info
They have hypersonic cruise missiles why would they send a balloon for that?

Russian state TV claims that Russia has been at war with the U.S. for 80 years. Propagandists compare America to a "medieval leper" that is trying to infect the rest of the world and suggest "exterminating Western parasites with chemicals or ice axes." https://t.co/En8ieevMbE

Blocked by the Russians, will upload it to Twitter. Watch it below 
Well..... Caesar and the Roman empire fell. Is that who they're trying to emulate? I wonder if the average Russian citizen even believes what is said on their talk show media.
Dis papa c'est quoi un russe nazi ?
Thanks
This is where the is headed. When reporting isn’t based on facts it just becomes fiction and that fiction gets wild.
Do they broadcast in the morning or in the evening? because they all look completely drunk to me ..
russians know what they are being looked as, and applying this to their enemies. Thus by claiming something before enemies claiming they are, its so called truth that they claim, instead of their enemies actually portraiting the real truth.
Jesus - They are so wrapped up in their version of the truth it is frightening.
Grazie per il tuo prezioso lavoro.
As has been pointed out previously imagine if you got all your news and information exclusively from Fox News for the last 40 years.
Why do these “ intellectuals” hate the west? Do they really? From what I understand they sure like to vacation here and the enjoy our products and businesses. I just don’t get the animosity. What have “done” to them?
боже, які вони ідіоти
These children really think we will play this game 
Omg. What a bunch of weirdo’s.
It's projection again. "Medieval leper" is an excellent description of russia.
"Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia."
I couldn't get a handle on what these people are talking about.  It's like they are grabbing words out the air.
Sounds like they’re ready to negotiate. Please, let us hear your “security concerns”
Ice axes? WTH?
Wtf did I just watch 
Double think is alive well on russian TV.  You get a much better picture from PTV.
 In January 1930, the future Marshal  Tukhachevsky drafted the concept of the "war of annihilation" against the West, which envisaged the  "massive use of chemical weapons". The aim of the war of aggression was to spread communist rule in Europe and the world by force of arms.
With all the serious over-thinking, negative fantasizing and multi-layered lying that seems to go on in Russia its no wonder they drink.
Ms. Davis, what is the reputation of a show like this inside Russia? Is this viewed as legit news or as a bunch of clownish blowhards?
I love that they have now appropriated one of Orwell's books. Obviously not "Animal Farm".
I have to admit, we could use some denazification in Idaho. #idpol
Dmitry Kulikov: -“This war with the US has been going on since 1945-for nearly 80 years “ It's getting weirder and crazier,  even for their ability
It's fascinating they always hyper-focus on previous world "leaders" for reference of what they should do, while completely ignoring those empires fell because it was a flawed system.
TL;DR breakdown of the video:   *Old men yelling about what young men should do from the comfort of their studio*
Julius Caesar was murdered by his own party—is this part the parallel they see?
Serious question. To what extent do the propagandists who espouse this stuff actually believe the words they say? I presume it depends on the person and/or topic.
Things I didn’t expect to learn today:  1) Lady Liberty is actually Lady Hecate, and,  2) Some people didn’t read all the way to the end of “Julius Caesar”
So the christian russian jihad will now use baloons,ice axes and the tactics of Dengis Kahn?
They are subtly implying that they are the USSR successor and heir. Far from the truth. 30 years later everyone moved on, but not Russia, they are living of the fumes of what they had. Instead should do as the other ex-republics and stop being insufferable vatniks.
At 2:24 we hear Yevgeny Satanovsky. How can anyone still tell reality from parody.
So their aims are the borders established by the Congress of Vienna- to include Warsaw, Finland and the Baltic states which they hope to conquer using the methods of Genghis Khan. Good luck with that.
Wow. Off the charts.
Is it a freak-show? 
The Cope is strong with this one, it endures
they are right
Russians suffer from jealousy &amp; envy and do not wish others a healthy and happy life.
Russia has been at war with the US for a very long time. US strategic military planning has been based on that premise also, for a very long time.
Just to troll Russia, I would like to make a giant balloon shaped like a toilet, and sail it over Russia.
It's... confusing.
I mean, is an ice axe the best way to kill a medieval leper? If we’re medieval lepers, I think the Russians should consider just leaving us be so the medievalism and leprosy just keeps doing it’s thing. Less effort for them, really.
What could they possibly have against baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet?
We haven't been at war with the Soviets for 80 years, but we should have been.
The Spectre base looks worried.
Тhe ussr (ссср)disappeared in 1991. russia appeared in 1991. Where did 80 years come from?
They just need to narrow their focus and discuss one topic in detail before going off on longwinded monologues of their wildest fantasies. You can see them waiting for their turn to talk irrelevant nonsense
Let them try if they want. 
…and blowhards.
To everyone puzzled by the “ICE AXE”: An Ice Axe was the weapon that Ramon Mercader, an assassin sent by Stalin, used to kill Leon Trotsky while exiled in Mexico.
Who is the meth-addled occult mystic in the leather vest? The one who claims that the Statue of Liberty is Hecate? I’m trying to decide why anyone would think that knook would make great TV.

#Projection level 11 here, amazing!
We’re not trying to do anything. Stay in your own country and fix up your mess and we won’t even need to talk to you Russians
haha what rocks are they lifting to find all these people?
Ice axes.....that's new.
that is wonderful
ah ah a feudal state (that is the way to be a prehistorical state soon) is saying that about USA? 
Russian state TV claims that Russia has been at war with the U.S. for 80 years and they've just noticed.
If you have to watch this every day on your TV set in Russia… you surely will not be a happy person. This will lead to a huge disconnection for sure.
I turned off but I did like the phrase...  "Where are our kites?"  Simplistic, muddled but most of injured.  If only they were as capable of looking forward as backwards.   Can a country be labelled narcissistic?
Ironic that right wing media in the US is infatuated with Russia
They can start by getting rid of Vlad!
kremlin pundits now say russia is fighting US since 1945 while suffering defaults and begging for humanitarian assistance from time to time
Kremelská paka...
More like Russia has been trying to blame the west for its dysfunction for 80+ years
They openly threaten also all other EU countries. Hope that every one in Western Europe will understand that Russia should be no more...
Russians invokes 1984, immediately claim Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.
Thanks for this. Their rhetoric and disinformation is getting worse and shows desperation. They know that if they go off script they’ll “accidentally fall down a set of stairs or fall out of a window somewhere “. No live audience either is there?
Again I ask? Other than the Kremlin, who is the audience in Russia that wants to hear nightly threats about going to war against NATO and using nuclear weapons? I'd imagine most ordinary people would find such rhetoric frightening, not inspiring.
Chemicals (Litvinenko, etc., etc.) and ice axes (Trotsky): yup, sounds like the Russian playbook has not changed.
This is what happens when cousins  marry and have children... the children's brain is deeply affected, and then they become this.
Thanks.  This was a good example of a Russian imperial circle jerk, I’m afraid.
Russia has been at war with the west for 80 years, the difference is the West has been playing a most inconsistent defense but hasn’t been at war with Russia.
They want to compete woth USA? In what?
So, Russia has been losing the same war for 80 years? Maybe it's time for a new strategy, eh?
Surely someone is already taking the chemicals ..... and also very heavy.
Super fancy set, and these guys talk and mostly look like alcoholics in Brooklyn dive bar.

 sadly the west comes to know this so late. It would have saved Billions of investment and support if we had known this before. But for future #NoFutureForRussia #visabanforrussians

Ну роССия может и в состоянии войны только США не знали, потому роССия и осталась в развитии в тех временах...
It's difficult to understand the purpose of state television. It's the doctrination of the political agenda of the nation. War with America is the political agenda of the nation. The Russians are seeding in their people that war against America becomes the "new good".
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHHAHAHHAAAHHAHAHHAAAAAAAA 
Is that the absolute GUFF that is appearing on Russian state tv??
They don't even hide their genocidal ambitions anymore.
If any russian believes this crap, they are fully deserving of the humbling that is coming soon.
The real nazis say what?
Classic cases of projection here. What absence of self-awareness!!
They are deadly serious. The West needs to prepare now before it is too late. They have already infiltrated our governments, media and institutions in preparation while we have our heads in the sand.
Denazification and demilitarisalation of the US is also our goal generally speaking.  There are nazis everywhere and only Russia is calling out and doing anything about it. How much longer can they keep repeating denazification?
That warmongering stooge of Putin wishes we'd been at war for 80 years so they could get the population psyched to go to war. The actual Cold War only lasted from 1945-1991.
They, and everyone else in this world can not keep the USA out their damn mouths.
How do you brainwash?  With a very good detergent (not sergeant) possibly with excellent commercials, with propaganda:  biased or misleading nature used to promote a political cause or point of view.  "he was charged with distributing enemy propaganda"
"Exterminate western parasites"... but they couldn't get Bakhmut after 11 months, call me when they mature, if they ever do! 
They have to have some rubbish to shout about. They're crackers!
Wow out of this entire video all you got was that that's some great clickbait
The propaganda train went off the rails quite a while ago. The s are completely loony.
Man I'd love for a Russian to try and attack me with an "ice axe"  it's my dream
There are peacemakers, and then there is the guy in the tweed jacket. They are only dangerous if people take them seriously.
Totally nuts! But dangerous nuts. #RussiaIsATerroristState #RussiaIsANaziState
What RU totalitarian terrorist regime is trying very hard to do here is NOT to find ways defeat Western allies, BUT DECEIVE the RU population that in this war RU academia &amp; intellectuals are involved, where as in reality it’s just the RU dictatorship that insists on this war!
Orwell, Stalin's friend. Preposterous.
All of this intellectual gymnastics and lying to convince people to die so Putin can keep his super yacht.
If its a war against america, why dont they attack them then, please do, just one time and rip ussia!
Thank you Julia. These guys talk so big but they can't occupy part of Ukraine. They have to know if they were really facing NATO troops they would be massacred.
Lowlife’s … yep…pretty much sums them up
Main goal of russian army is to take bakhmut, job of propagandists is to make fantasies....
The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to celebrate freedom. The end of slavery &amp; oppression. The ideals of freedom are THE biggest threat to a dictatorship bc its people might see it &amp; want their freedom too. They have to demonize democracy to stay in power.
the only parasite is Russian state, like cancer its been growing for the past 700 years, bigger and bigger, swallowing up territories and ethnic groups along its path and relocating their inhabitants to other places to wipe out any notion of nationality other than Russian.
I hope everyone watching this realizes that the ice axe is an allusion to murder of Trotsky and is a call to send assassins after the US and European politicians Russians do not approve of?
He Julia, who's watching these clown shows? I know some Russians living here in Germany, they're no dumb people at all but they are Putin fans in majority unfortunately. It's a homeland thing I think. You cannot discuss with them. No chance. They're so stubborn.
of course, the Russians banned George Orwell, '1984' and 'Animal Farm's author was hated by the communists. In the upside down world of Russia 2023 we are now to believe the Russians love George Orwell.   This host's bonkers narrative gets crazier by the minute OMG
They really look like a drunk group of old men voicing stupid opinions in a bar.
The retorics are still dangerous, as they sell the ideas of a nuclear solution to their own problems. Lock them up, thoose war criminals.
This is of no surprise. Everyone knows how much Russian like to lie in order cope. The simple fact is they have been playing the Nazi playbook on propaganda and war all along and are the only Nazi element left in this world.
Russians are doing what they are doing long before the american continent was discovered. Don't fall for any of this "the world exists for only for 100 years" bullshit-talk. History is way longer and darker &amp; this fucking region called "RuZZia" knows it perfectly.
1, they're still dangerous as they voice their threats pretty straightforward, very little euphemisms. 2, these aren't just village fools but professors etc., so it IS an official voice of a ru society stratum. 3, bright side: more new faces mean older ones have failed
Stop attention this
Their propaganda is going so  complex that old russian babooshkas, who are anymore watching tv, dont understand it.
They want to attack us with KITES?
What are our propagandists saying in response?
I have written this before, thank you for your fortitude in listening to and translating this Russian bullshit. Similar to many that listen to Fox News extremists, I wonder how many Russian citizens actually believe this crap.
I just ini am interested y Orwel novels is prohibited in Russia. A specially if it is about US?
They are right across the board. You Yankees are the cancer of the world, sooner or later you will be wiped out. The change has already begun 
They've been drinking some really nasty and psychosis inducing liquids in Moscow lately.  What a shame.
It just shows how heartless Russians are! jealousy from a single country! Waged war on a country and it's people for nothing!Talk about using nukes show they could careless about their own lives! Mental honestly!
Well, we have been involved in several proxy wars with USSR/Russia over the years. USSR and China supported North Korea during the Korean War. USSR supported the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. The US supported the Afghan fighters when USSR invaded. This is nothing new.
They are sick are Putins puppets
They are bonkers. Its funny how Daniil Solovoyev, Vlad's son, has been packed of to Orwellian London. The hypocrisy of it. Maybe we should deliver him back on the Bakhmut front line!
This is some North Korea shit.
 Russian clowns rewrite history daily. Thugs hiding behind WMDs committing war crimes to steal profits from others. Everything else is fantasy. #RussiaIsATerroristState #StopRussia #ArmUkraineNow
Transparent projections, thick twats.
I wish I wouldn't have listened to that - it is absolutely painful how stupid they know resident Russian really are
Wow. Their heroes are Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, and they call for the assassination of heads of state of their perceived enemies, and to revert to the Russian empire of the 1800s. They are seriously deluded.
 the commie piece of shit Russians would know if they were at war with the US for 80 years as Russia would not exist. Russians are soft cannon fodder and nothing more. Watching Ukraine decimate Russia with a rag tag army has proven Russia is soft and weak as fuck.
Oh f them
If you dream of peace fkrs...why attack?! Simple
They make it up as they go along, open their mouth, forget the brain, pissants
Oh my god Julia I think I will explode!!!! Do you ever send this shit to Biden? I mean,for real! These fkrs are now resulting to using Roman an Greek and Egyptian history to justify what they are doing. AND still taking no responsibility for starting this!
What morons.
What a bunch of brain dead idiots.
If she had any b=ains what so ever she would stuff a bomb up her ass and light the fuse and got sit on putins lap
Russia is a shit country and they are continuously at war, for the last several hundred years. Russia must be destroyed.
The Russians are whining and whining and whining and whining and whining and whining and . Poor poor Russia. Bad bad Ukraine. Poor poor Russia. Bad bad USA. Poor poor Russia. Bad bad Europe. 
Oh boy, imagine being dumb enough to believe this nonsense 
How old crazy orcs destroy the future of generations young Russians
If you knobheads was in war with USA for real, you would be dead already  It's sickening to listen to their stupidity....
Those guys are nuts
And I thought CNN was full of whackos this team is even worse
Day 354 - RUSSIAN ROADS MADE FROM UKRAINIAN BONES, BLOOD, HAIR, CLOTHING
These people, jezz , their lunatics and the sad thing is dumb people eat it up
Why all the UFO talk and China spy balloons right now?  Something has to distract you from the perfectly healthy athletes collapsing, the cancer rates skyrocketing, and blood clots the size of Amazonian boa constrictors.
Ohio train bio terrorism. Infants being poisoned with mRna. Epstein pedophiles.
So what private group or person is launching these balloons? It’s interesting because now following the directions they are coming from following wind currents in the US and China, it seems the only central launching spot is Russia. Chaos operation?
Weird 
Well, there is a good chance they have always been in the air, just higher and at different times. Some people call them satellites. It is possible these are satalloons experiencing altitude regression.
But Russia sending balloons into our airspace would only give the Ukraine neocons even more storylines to push for an all out war against Russia. That doesn't make sense... I don't know enough about Russia to know of a group not aligned with Putin that would want this to happen
The 1st few were balloons then military who normally leaves them alone shot down UFOs thinking they were balloons.  It has all the hallmarks of UFOs even capable of scrambling avionics(an act of war)  Notice they don't release pics like they did immediately w balloons?
Probably coming from Ukraine paid for with our tax monies.
North Korea
Distraction from Twitter, hunter, covid
Well ya. But even still, it’s worth knowing what is going on.
Just heard a speaker Spaces. Re: balloons, ufo's, the chemical explosion in Ohio, poisoning farm land &amp; some cattle have died, etc. He speculated this is New World Order; A Full on Assault in many different forms, happening in different  places. As you said  "CHAOS OPERATION"
Perhaps. Don’t know.
Ohio: Dead fish and cattle being reported as far as 100 miles away from the site.   Journalists covering the story have been arrested.  What the HELL is going on?
The recent story of Nordstrom was leaked by our own government in order to try to provoke a response from Putin  Also, look at the pretty balloons. It's China. It's a UFO  Anything to distract from The Twitter Files Trials AND to simultaneously have excuse for war  Wake up pleebs
Joe Biden is shooting down Chinese spy balloons and drones. UFOs  Talk about TOUGH on China, unlike Donald Trump who hid them from the public because he is WEAK Dear MAGA! https://t.co/d7FKxO9plJ
Vanky’s patents took priority over National security.
Hey Joe, just build a wall across Alaska, like you did around your house and the Capital.
Good job completely making that up.
Why do you say Trump hid them from the public?  How do you know that?  Where did you get your information?
They're probing us to gage our response.
Puhlease
This hasn’t happened prior.
trump not like tell balloon
I can’t wait until these bots disappear
This didn't happen under trump that was debunked. Nice try though.
Seriously? You don't keep up with actual news, do you.
He was caught letting china reconnaissance balloons travel the United States so now they have to pretend to be aggressive on China... just remember buttercup,  the east and west coast will be the first areas they invade.
And you still want to share a country with them
You are an EFFin idiot to believe this. Use your brain man.
they are occupying  as much media space as they can so they don't speak of hunter's laptop, the covid scam, inflation or the twitter files hearing... well play democrats, well play !
It really isn’t any wonder why China isn’t bothered about a back lash from the US military about the #Balloons spying from above.   What would these ‘titans of defence’ do, glitter bomb Beijing with pretty colours 🙄 https://t.co/kNgNRqnGkQ
Disgusting
Yup Putins crapping himself . . 
What has happened in our society????
I don’t know but it can’t go on the way it is.
Lots of gongs, presumably for conspicuous gallantry in the face of misgendering.
Many of them are rape victims who went on to whore out the next #VanessaGuillen: 1) ask M. Christina 2) who called out Senator Ernst
HAHAHAHA  Biden defends nothing not even China made balloons.  People, Biden had the power to secure social security with the votes from the HOuse and Senate.  What did they do??   NOTHING  They went ahead and used these monies to levereage from the budget to give others
Rick Scott wants to sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years.
You think Biden had the house and senate?
They used the VP to pass what they wwanted.  Pretty clear.
At least Brandon shot down the balloons. The Cheeto in Chief was too busy playing golf to shoot down the ones during his time
Shoot down China balloon over Atlantic ocean. Criticized for waiting. Shoot down UFOs quickly. Criticized for shooting them down without finding out where they came from. Funny.
US and Canada will analyze the wreckage to find the origin of these UFOs.  Relax.
Now China. But if China claimed the ones over us were from them, who is sending balloons over China. 🤔
Maybe China is floating balloons to test the veracity of the idiom? nah... pooh bear and the gang dont do anything that doesnt increase their geo-political and domestic power.  Its stupid, but it has purpose.  From currency deval to commodity hoarding globally, its all the same.
What is keeping China from putting chemical warfare in one of those balloons? #ChinaSpyBalloon
you have to ask 3 toes that
Lol not when you don't have access to them,  actors are actors not presidents , plus I'll send you proof that it wasn't a China balloon it was launched from Fairchild AFB in Washington,  why did it take Biden so long to shoot it down. That's a hell of a cut in the bk of Joe's… https://t.co/Q1Wid99d1D
Good morning and happy Sunday. Word has it that China will be giving us a play-by-play for the super bowl this evening from inside one of their state-of-the-art balloons!
Here is the article. He is cited in that article, which has a map of the location, making it clear he didn't search "all of Inner Mongolia", and certainly didn't spend 12 hours doing it. Some people have a tendency for the dramatic...  https://t.co/FeplccTEed
But balloons 🎈 from China is ok?
* OBJECT SEEN AS EIGHT-SIDED, NO DISCERNIBLE PAYLOAD: OFFICIAL   * BIDEN DIRECTED LATEST SHOOTDOWN OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION   * UNMANNED OBJECT WAS AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET: SENIOR US OFFICIAL  (via
"We don't know what it is"... "shoot it down"  something here doesn't make sense... They know what it is.
Chinese media report 6am Eastern [ 8pm Beijing ]  Rizhao, Shandong, China UFO in territorial offshore airspace. Intend to shoot it down. https://t.co/amFLjz7CtW
Possible balloon sources  1. China 2. North Korea  3. Russia 4. Gender reveal out of control 5. Loose music festival balloon 6. Children’s party 7. Actual ufo from planet circus 9. From a real estate open house showing 10. Loose alien balloon from Area 51
None of the above. It’s the Goodyear Blimp
Even Biden wouldn’t shoot down the Goodyear blimp
Aww yes, those gender reveal people 
I'm 50 / 50 4 and 10. Of course, they are not mutually exclusive!
maybe the guy with the lawn chair?
We thought Russia’s military was much more capable than they turned out to be. Is it possible China’s spy program is actually relying on intelligence from balloons? 🤷🏽‍♀️ #DemVoice1 https://t.co/ZlzsW5F0lI
China tested these in 2018. Hypersonic vehicles dropped from high altitude from balloons. https://t.co/paYeCvdqJ3
That serial liar biden ordered anything shot down. This is all fake crap from his failure to shoot down the China Balloon. Try thinking
Our national security and safety is always a top priority. I’ve been in contact with the federal government and our partners who were tracking an object near our airspace. I’m glad to report it has been swiftly, safely, and securely taken down. The stands ready.
I’m a glad all the officials that represent us.. keep lying and not telling us what it is.
What is the specific lie here?
Why is it that I'm of the impression that our government is having people float out weather balloons dressed up as UFO's to shoot down so that we can produce a "Wag The Dog" war with China to divert from Ukraine &amp; domestic cockups like #EastPalestine?
Good luck fighting war with Russia...or China...or Chinese spy balloons...or (supposedly we are now led to believe by media) UFO's now raining down over USA...if our formerly young &amp; healthy military pilots are sick or dying from Covid vaccine. #DISASTER https://t.co/oQ0bvDtPiz
Wait look over there it's a spy balloon from China, no wait look over there it's a ufo. Squirrel! Squirrel! Squirrel!
Remember we learned about the China spy balloon from social media. What does that tell you?
What intel could China get from a balloon that they couldn’t get from their satellites in the sky?   Kinda seems like it was done to poke the bear to get a reaction.
hurt the most
Concur
1. I don't think it was Chinese. 2. I don't think it was gathering Intel for the Chinese.
…go on…
It's a psyop. Nobody is talking about the government being directly involved with the pipeline bombing, or the chemical fire in Ohio, or the fact that there's irrefutable proof of the entire Biden family committing felonious acts.
Sure thing, 7 follower account who's never written a tweet! I'll get right on that after I block you.
Signals possibly
Explain? Talk to me like the civilian I am
Lower altitude, longer loitering might make for better interception of communications information.  Seems like the most viable advantage over satellites.
Think it had the ability to transmit data live back to CCP?
GPR makes sense, particularly for the Montana one. There are a lot of nuclear silos out there and coincidentally, Huawei has generously sold the local ISPs their tech to put up all over their cell towers in that area too.
I think response was the sole intention. See how much They can get away with for how long, and what the US reaction would be
Thank god for that woman in MT who looked up and saw it. Otherwise I’m not sure we would have ever known about it.
Man. We can track UFOs from millions of miles away but somehow a Ballon slips in undetected
My understanding is that it did not sneak in at all. They knew where it was before it crossed into US waters near the Aleutians.
Satellites have predictable overpass windows, balloons don’t.
They do when they are spotted from the ground
Only if you set your radar to detect objects moving slow with a small RCS. An H6 bomber is never going to be doing 60 knots at 60k feet. These balloons vastly increase the number of objects we must now track and classify. Balloons are also cheap.
Ditto the payload.  You can build a sensor package designed to fill the same role far cheaper if it doesn't have to be launched into space on the back of a rocket accelerating at 3.8-5.9g.
I suspect its a test of stealth detection capabilities for a potential future kinetic use.
It is the difference of time over target. Satellites are out of range for the majority of their orbit. An balloon or other non orbital platform is over the collection target much longer. Make sense?
Also don't forget the different types of surveillance they are doing. Not everything is a traditional camera/photo. Ground penetrating radar, lidar, and other RF/signals surveillance equipment need to be lower/slower than a satellite too.
Correct
They clearly aren’t for surveillance. As you stated, their satellites can see everything the balloon could have. Possibly some sort of communication intercept or more. But they weren’t for surveillance.
I thought the first balloon had SIGINT equipment. Floating over the US and soaking up every transmission it can while also testing our response, im guessing.
Our response and reaction is the intel. They get to see response time, type of response, radar signature of response, media coverage, collective twitter outrage, etc.
it's basically the same thing as when they buzz warships in the pacific - everything to gauge reaction, until eventually we stop reacting
Faint &amp; short distant comms, would never make it through the atmosphere into space.
Half poking a bear. But I imagine regardless of how great a picture they get from space its still going to be much better from 40k feet.
They are testing our military response for an EMP strike before they invade Taiwan.
Activating the brain chips in the sleeper cells 
Ok so serious thought. What about ground penetrating radar? Or telecomms? Like sms texts and data transfers.   Just things I’ve thought of. Nothing but speculation.
Signals intelligence. Recording radar positions and frequencies, monitoring communications and positions of relay stations.  These kinds of surveillance are why we still fly the U2 even though we have satellites.
Why don’t they just look at Google Maps in satellite mode?
Probably detailed SIGINT of our nuclear sites, also it passed over where the new B21 raiders are being produced so idk.
Good height for decent impact for a  device designed for HEMP damage? 30-40 miles high is considered optimal but a device 10-12. miles up would still impact a pretty large part of the continental US.
I think it's just propaganda We don't shoot it down "Look america too weak to protect airspace" We shoot it down "Look america scared of stray weather balloons lol"  I think that's all it is.
A lot actually. Satellites are awesome but they really only give you a look. Their orbit is too high to get radio and wifi. The balloons can soak up everything and route that info to a satellite for later dissection.
SIGINT birds typically orbit between 600 km and 39k km, and ground penetrating radar doesn't work from orbit.  SIGINT sensors at 80km are smaller and cheaper for the same sensitivity.
Agree with both. The former is not an excuse to let it go unmolested.
Oh ya!
I think a balloon could be a cheap way to test a global satellite communication system the Chinese seem to be building.
There are a few things which is why we still have some balloons ourselves.
None of it makes sense. Just part of the circus act I guess.
Its a "trial" baloon to find out what we can see with our radar and test our responses.
China sucks out loud at spaceflight so them using balloons is very unsurprising
Smell
Dwell time is all I can think of. Get a little closer for a little longer. Beyond that it was probably more about the detection ability of our systems. Which is clearly piss poor.
High resolution imagery of terrain, not limited by turbidity and diffraction. Magnetic, gravimetric, and radiological information as well as signals intelligence.
I'm pretty sure satellites are 130+ miles up. These balloons were reported to be 20k-80k feet high. I'm guessing you would not only be able to intercept radio frequencies but also get much better imagery.
It was a trial run. For something to follow.
There could've been a variable required that only balloon travel could provide (sound, heat, vibration...).
Sigint easier via lower and slower?
I wouldn't know, but I heard someone say they suspected it was a test run for an EMP device. That altitude would be a perfect height to deploy, knocking out 90% of electronics without having a missile launch detected...
Well.. if you have the same optics at 60,000 ft as at 600 miles in orbit, you're gonna get better detail.  But detail of what?  What is going to be exposed that would be at all interesting to them?  Yeah.. just doesn't make a lot of sense. Unless it's the Norks with no satellites
I was told that the resolution is much better that close to the ground. As opposed to satellite  imagery.
Done to get eyes off of Ohio and the train chemicals spilled.
There are things you can get from a balloon that you don’t get from satellites.   Radar frequencies.  Radar intensities at distances from transmitters.  Radio frequencies.  Response times. Types of responses. Lots of other stuff.
They could be trying to get intel on this, or other communications systems.
What if their satellites are as clear/reliable as typical Chinese made optics?
China doesn’t have satellites over America.
Or to let other nations see them petering the bear's mug.
Our U2 and SR71 were able to take pictures without atmospheric interference.
I expect that it's state encouraged, but not state directed.
Exactly the purpose. What are US EW capabilities? Can we penetrate them? What is their response? Where does it launch from when we are at ‘X’ location? The list goes on…
I've seen this question alot. Positioning a sat,  would be extremely expensive, easily noticed, and wouldn't be guaranteed to see through possible weather. Also they would have to account for space debris and others sats in its path.
Reaction time. That’s it.
Their satellites don’t get live real time data of our f-22s shooting them down.   They probably just wanted to see what our new fighters were capable of at altitude.
Considering this hostile regime just killed over 1.1 million American civilians..... anything is possible, and they can't be trusted.
The easy way to think of it is that balloon was about 11 miles high. Low earth orbit is 1,200 miles- or 100x more distant.   We COULD talk about our most secretive and expensive $$$ intelligence agency nobody has heard of called the National Reconnaissance Office.
Maybe their satellites are shit like a lot of their other equipment.
Satellites!?  Biden invited TikTokers to the oval office.  Pretty sure China has every government and military installation geo mapped from people walking around with TikTok open on their phones.
They don't have access to Google Earth there either
They have done this years. As have we and all major countries. Even the French back in the day. What we are witnessing is another mass hysteria / psyche-op. /why/ should become clear soon I think.
Pretty sure Satellites can't pick up cell signals traveling tower to tower. The point of the balloon is likely pick up radio waves that don't reach space.  They don't have to be special military etc.  They could gather text &amp; phone calls from military personnel.
Signals package suck up all the traffic?
ok - wild thought - but what if the balloons carried over drones which had specific purposes... such as tampering with railways?
China spy balloon: Beijing’s military adventures are nothing new. A useful commentary on why China is using reconnaissance balloons, from Peter Hartcher in  https://t.co/1PwA409Et1

Please summarise I no longer subscribe to SMH
Fu)king paywall
The ‘outrage theater’ is in full swing. When they start talking about Chinese spying through TikTok or their many satellites, we’ll know it’s serious.
Poorly written article by the Political and international editor, seems to play down the event.
Os animo a RT y darle like al hilo y comentar. Una histeria colectiva género una batalla contra la nada , y la situación es muy similar a la crisis de #ballons espía. Hay que sacar lecciones de la historia
Put subtitles in english…
"It's not uncommon as well for the US to illegally enter the airspace of other countries,"  "Since last year alone, US balloons have illegally flown above China more than 10 times without any approval from Chinese authorities," Balloon danger Blown Up out of all proportion? https://t.co/tlJeO6S8lu
There are many spy satellites belonging to many nations up there. Why are the US suddenly upset by balloons?
It stops people talking about their act of war, international terrorism, and ecocide, when they blew up the Nord stream pipelines?
Global 1% are all playing a game of misdirection while they continue to fleece the people.
A lot of internal buffoonery. Elections due soon. Look at us democrats saving the world while Trump let balloons fly over endangering our security. Not Biden  he stands up to all the treats. Vote for us.
How come the mainstream media doesn’t report on this but the spy balloon from China was the top story every day?
A foreign power sending over a spy device over US for 7 days?
One is a matter of national security. One is not.
Train issue is known and contained. The China spy balloons continue unabated and bring into natijnal security discussions alarm over advanced surveillance technologies used in aeronautics these days that's not been carefully studied..
Not any toxic chemical, the stuff that make PVC pipes with and causes cancer
Is this Twitter page run by the CCP? Sounds very suspicious.
They are covering the truth using a Chinese ballon to fool American people.
It's all controlled, also it doesn't take much stupid 'merica jingoism to excite the boomers.
Besides the fact that this is displayed on my feed numerous times a day? On every social media platform as well as mainstream news outlet? Who purports this narrative that this isn't being covered?!
Because you only subscribe to China news?
Spy balloon doesn't negatively effect a black rock investment
Thank you for giving this awful man-made disaster some coverage!! Unlike you, they don't care! They use incidents to full advantage to bring in the NWO, the globalist agenda. Whatever it is... weather, mechanical, political, etc., Globalists make the most of any crisis- double it
Strange? This is a copy of Hua Chunying post? CCP wumao exposed?
Spy balloons coming from China like: https://t.co/7nbp8eDTpv
No kidding!!
It seemed like a very Chinese thing when they came out
Our enemies float objects into U.S. airspace to observe what elements of the U.S. military react and how.  Our enemies know that if X floated objects can sufficiently distract U.S. defenses, then Y ICBMs could follow X objects and that would be the end of the United States.
No those were sperm!!! And Riri was the egg!!!!
Sorry but that looks a lot more like decontamination suits to me.
white is for death in China, red is for life, weddings, luck

Spy balloons… looks like Democrat white hoods
Sperm's???
Not really sure what the hell that was all about. Another terrible halftime performance is what that was to me. Lip synch much?
Dressed in red and pregnant. The ritual is on.
Lmaoooo
That was our thoughts exactly! 
Thanks that’s made my day 
 but so true …
I think we found the Chinese Nationals that crossed the Southern Border! 
It's California coming to reclaim 
This is the one spotted over China today. I think it’s a UFO
Laughing &amp; Bragging
20 morons in hazmat suits
That’s what it looked like
Mr Puff from Ghostbusters
Teletubbie invasion
Marshmallow-men  …or tampons…cause the red
 what is this from?
Or the deep state taking credit for the Ohio disaster
They look like virology suits!
You missed them fanning there farts and holding themselves doing the potty dance.
&amp; one big blood clot
They want me to focus on race so here I go….  Rihanna only had black dancers so does that make her a racist? WHERE IS THE DIVERSITY?   This is the way forward, I can feel it…so much fun to separate people based on things they can’t control!!!
So all the balloons just an ad for the halftime show or U2?? 
I thought it was an Oompa Loompa invasion!
Think of all the people involved in planning that freakshow all thinking "yeah, this is great!"
That's fantastic!
One of the worst with the most ridiculous costumes
The halftime show did have a “China lockdown” vibe going didn’t it?
Covid wear
Looks like a KKK meeting... White robes and white hoods.
Dancing sperm to me
Pilsbury Dough boys
Pov: you coughed in front of left wingers
CP words of wisdom sir?
Looks like black men in Kkk suits
Sperm going after the egg
This is not funny Daily Wire.  Mockery
Is this what was in the spy balloons we shot down?
Terrible show
Looks a black KKK rally.
I thought it was a Klan dance....
I think it was 200 sperms.
Baby Staypuff marshmallow men.
Why even post this . Useless tweets .
These costumes were very strange
3 Unidentified Flying Objects and a spy balloon in less than a month.   Are they all from China?  From Aliens?  Or Just a Distraction?   Furthermore, do you trust our government to tell us the truth about them?
You can either understand history, or you can trust your government. You can’t do both.
On a publicly monitored platform such as Twitter… of course I trust my government… 100%… like sooo much trust… it’s hard to describe all the trust… like, I don’t know how much an F-22 costs but it’s way more than that… you mean our government, right?
I have zero trust.
distraction
I’ll take distraction for $1000 please Alex.
They’ll likely be paternal and tell us what they think would be in our best interest  Where from ?  I’d think the satellites could have tracked origins
Dont think Aliens… most likely foreign. We should be told what they are though by
Feels more distraction-y than the other options, however I really want it to be aliens lol.   And I trust the fed gov as much as the sushi from the gas station for $1 that's half off.
Definitely don’t trust the government to tell the truth, especially with what’s happening in Ohio right now
Idk. Idk. Idk. Definitely not.
No.  No.  Yes. Absolutely not.
I smell cover-up news to overshadow Ohio....
I’ll choose distraction too although I’d love if they were aliens. Problem is, were aliens to visit, our government would be hostile. I’d prefer welcoming them for trade and learning.
Does our government ever tell us the truth?
I don't trust this administration to give me the time of day, these "incidents" are gonna be the precursor to some pretty terrible things that come into reality soon. I voted for you madame president, but the drones decided to go another way. I truly believe we should've had you!
“… do you trust our government…” 
No to all four
Who do you trust to get the information from then? I get that the government has lied before, but who else has access to this information to tell us the truth?
It's a cat toss, in a horror movie people are unaware they are featured in.  "Don't look behind the mirror!"
Absolutely not
One of our local reps told the press today, in reference to the one over Lake Huron, 'We don't know what it is, but we do know that it's not a UFO.'  Apparently she doesn't know what 'UFO' means.
I had been saying to everyone that’ll listen… “think about what you KNOW is true” … norad didn’t just pick these up suddenly unless they went above radar level (57ft) meaning they either knew of them(and allowed it) or they took off from American soil
Probably. Who knows. Don’t know. No.
I think it's from the government. They have us looking at the sky as they are hiding something else they are doing.
Just a distraction, And No. They'll say just enough to keep people distracted from their horrible policy failures.
Polygraph every word that comes from the WH press room regardless of who is at the podium. They don’t say the same thing 2 days running!
If they are from aliens, then either the aliens wanted to allow them to be destroyed, or they wouldnt have been destroyed. Seems more likely similar to #MinistryOfTruth, admitting publicly something they've been doing for years.
If/when Biden addresses the nation, he’ll be extremely vague and play mind games to make himself look good because he “did something.”
5 actually, 2 shot down in Canada 3 in US
They all came from you, Jo.
Anyone who believes Biden will be truthful about this are in for a not that big surprise
No but I don't really trust you either didn't you want open borders
Subterfuge.
It’s not aliens. And I trust our government less and less.
Distraction from what's going on in Ohio
No. Maybe. Maybe. No. I once made fun of the "Laser Tower" concept.  Now, not so much.
It’s a smokescreen and no I don’t trust our government
Distraction!
I trust our government as much as I trust an employer who says that OT is optional......
Lol why arnt they telling us anything?...... Not that I'd believe  them anyway!   So it don't matter what they say or if they say anything? Here's the attention you wanted
I definitely don’t trust our government to tell us the truth about whats going on. they haven’t told the truth with other things these past few years, so why would UFOs be any different?
It has to be a distraction because these things have plagued our skies for ages. Why the sudden interest now? And no I don't trust them to tell us the truth. I'm sure the narrative has already been written and will be fed to us shortly. 
I believe the UFOs identified as aliens
It's actually 8 days, 40ish more are being watched around the world,  China maybe,  aliens doubtful,  distraction definitely,  and no our government will not give us the whole story.
I think they are psyop ploys to convince the public to support the push for WWIII.
I trust the government about as far as I can throw our government. U do the math.
Also, do you remember when all flights were grounded for a day when the entire system mysteriously went down. Transportation Secretary has/had no answer. Connected?
Oh Hell no
No one believes official stories anymore (and for good reason).   This is what happens when the media and political establishment lie to you every day.
I only see a few possibilities of what happened in #Ohio with the #ohiotrainderailment.  Namely due to the arresting of reporters.  1) the gubbermint is this incompetent and they don't want you to know this is how positively inept they are. 2) there is fuggery going on with -
I don’t trust the government and I wouldn’t trust you either
Like is it possible to get the answer day 1?
How &amp; would you tell the public if you were POTUS?
Trust government 
Don't trust the Government
I only trust them to lie.
I am not not a US citizen but no, I do not trust the American government. And they are probbaky responsible for the pipeline disaster.
I do not trust my government to tell me the truth.
I don't know about that other stuff but I don't trust the government to tell me the truth about what day of the week it is.
I definitely do not trust the government to tell the truth, about anything
Who are you? -Millennials ft Gen Z
I don't trust the govt not to sacrifice their own children much less me or mine
The government wouldn't tell the truth even if they was nothing to lie about
Well Jo I don’t really about a balloon, or Ukraine in a war they’ve refused to negotiate peace.   Currently wondering what is going to happen to my kids if they drink water because of controlled burn of chemicals.   You should take a look. Guaranteed to be deadly soon
Definitely do not
I just our government as much as a fart after eating Taco Bell
It's a distraction. What's really going on behind the curtains
No. I do not even trust the Govt to open a banana.
Of course I dont trust the government.
Yes from China no not Aliens yes a distraction and no I dont trust the govt
How are you still relevant??
at least one China, the others likely not, but setting us up for " look, all these UFO/UAP are just balloons....nothing to see here "
The one that went down up here is probably the “thing” ufo, coolest movie ever (all versions), but Kurt Russell was my favorite, see how quickly I’m distracted:)
I dont trust anything the Government tells us. They constantly lie to us.
They are liars. Anyone victimized by their corrupted FISA court fusion center “domestic terrorist watchlist” which turns out is 70% women over 40…and children. On. Tax. Dollars. I became a #TargetedIndividual bc I reported a rape at #TraderJoes. You need to learn the abuse…
Distractions and I don’t trust any coerced and paid off “state media” or politicians but the sheeple will follow, waiting for the alien inclusive flags
Distraction.  Ukraine robbery. Covid-19 robbery. Like a magician. Moving that other distracting hand around while they do the trick mostly unnoticed in the other hand.  Nordstream bombed by USA.  Wtf . This is all another Iraq and weapons of mass distraction lol 
Ask Schumer! He said all balloons!
Distraction from US  #Hyperinflation.
China is already "spying"via devices they mfg. Lol....
If the balloon really came from China, it would say "The USA blew up Nord Stream 2" in big bold letters.
BREAKING We've acquired exclusive footage of the most recent spy balloon shot down over usa.
True.
The balloons are a distraction and at the same time are meant to manufacture consent for war with China. Also included are those UFOs supposedly being shot down. Remember the US staged a fake Japanese invasion of Los Angeles complete with anti aircraft rockets and searchlights.
Facts being reported about facts.
Enough with the balloons  Can't stand the wasted hot air coming from the media.. Remember Fentanyl (from China) killing 1000s off our youth.without a shot fired Corrupt Biden crime syndicate Dems pushing WWIII THE Border - Biden not protecting our nation his #1 job Media Wake up https://t.co/aP3B6Xl1zZ
Very interesting data on Chinese balloon/airship programs and activities starting to surface.   "China’s Top Airship Scientist Promoted Program to Watch the World from Above" via The New York Times  https://t.co/tuHi9lp6ii https://t.co/MD2ZYw9Ksy
There are like 25 companies presently offering eclipse tours, horizon tours, stratosphere tours
Of all those companies I know only one which potentially could be capable to reach the goal.   80% percent of the rest, so far, is only marketing.
Sorry, i should have gotten specific. There are about 25 companies proposing their ideas and trying to get authorization.  We have had a  crash already from their test flights including one recently in India.   The point I was trying to make is, it's not a new concept.
but look who I am talking to. Ill shut up.
LoL ... just an enthusiast. Don't worry.
1. The Hunter Laptop story was gaining a foothold showing Biden's payoffs from China. 2. Suddenly a balloon crisis occurs and I'm supposed to thing Biden is being tough on China. 3. The balloon 'crisis' is an orchestrated political stunt. https://t.co/3nGaVwYuM0
Do you believe the “Chinese” balloon was really from China?
At this point, who the hell know's that is willing to tell us? Aside from Jesus, who can we really trust?? Crazy times we in to say the least my brother!!
Maybe the first, The rest no.
Naw. It’s a distraction. The timing of this is suspect
I don't know. However, I do believe it was some sort of distraction to keep us from hearing about the big Project Veritas and the mutating virus story.
Definitely. They were just testing out Chinese food delivery obviously. Before Besoz gets to it.
No I heard there was English writing on it.
Either way, I don't believe a word they say. China, our own government, Canada, none of the Countries around the world. If it isn't from GOD it's suspect.
Yes but it wasn't for surveillance, it was a test run for a military action. Most likely some type of EMP attack
I believe EVERYTHING right now is a MASSIVE distraction.
No clue. It was a distraction from the Ohio story imho
No. It’s ours, big distraction.
Not really
Yes.  The 1st one , likely from China.     These Balloons are common.  Commercials even exist from companies who make them.  I can show you a link if you like, to the commercial.  But it is not the same as everything else they're shooting down.  It is what I think.
Naw, prob govt filled with a new deadly strain of covid or something else to poison the air then blame all the new deaths on these "chemical crashes" with the trains and trucks
What is the balloon "object's" propulsion system?  Wind.  From where?  Russia or the Pacific (China).  Perhaps Russian subs or air drops. https://t.co/IUmB4w2Pkv
It’s not uncommon for balloons like this to have a simple fan like propulsion on top. We never saw it though as most images were of the bottom.
For all we know this was an advertising balloon shaped like an octagon. It had "strings hanging from it".  Did something get loose?
That’s a really good question. Even Amazon sells high altitude balloon rigs. Wouldn’t take much to rig a controlled payload drop.
Lol. We will never know.  They put cheech and Chong on the committee to study that.
Kirby let it slip that these are "controllable" and capable of loiter
A HARP was fired 179 km into the upper atmosphere in 1965 by Dr Gerald Bull at McGill University with his "gun" in Barbados. That's over 580,000 feet up. Something could float a long ways in the jet stream if it simply was built to glide.
Are they ours?
I'm going with either: 1.  No.  Because we'd know what they were faster. 2. Yes.  But we can't really say what they are because they are doing some kind of illegal domestic project.
Remember when they tried to FF a missile from Ukraine into Poland and blame it on Russia?  Citizens were able to photograph the pieces and see that it was Ukrainian. Maybe that's why they waited to shoot down the first one.  Didn't want it falling into the hands of a truther.
Breaking: China just released their footage from the China balloon  https://t.co/nr42hlS7Ul
Rihanna distracting us from the UFOs distracting us from the pipeline distracting us from the China balloon distracting us from the Ohio train wreck it’s all connected
What Biden doesn’t seem to realize is that real Americans aren’t mad at China for the balloons, they’re mad at HIM for not protecting us from any enemy who would do this to us. So yeah, genius, you can’t dig yourself out of this one. No spin 🤨😏
But Biden had the ballon shot down, and heightened security.  What do you want?  Trump knew there were Chinese balloons over Florida and did nothing.  Nor did he look for any more.
I’m mad at both of em so 
The right is/are the spinners of facts, and always leave out the rest of the story.
China is not your enemy, your Government is. This Balloon nonsense is just that "NONSENSE" to cover up what is happening in Ohio, what is the biggest risk balloons that could be brought down with an air rifle or a chemical spill. They are even claiming Alien Invasion lol.
BREAKING:— China calls out the US of “illegally” flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since Jan 22, as bilateral tensions flare in the fallout from a Chinese balloon shot down by American fighter jets after traveling the continental US. #spyballoon https://t.co/KONCk1VKUw
Hahaha right china , sureee
If USA ever sent balloons in there? They would’ve said it ages ago I wouldn’t have waited till now to say something
More than 10??  You are absolutely liar.
The real America without balloons.
We were not allowed by CCP calling Covid #ChineseVirus - that was too racist.  From the same reason we are not supposed to call balloons Chinese.  So let's wait for Chinese missiles to be sure they are coming really from China.
The difference is the Chinese *wanted* to admit they deliberately were behind the antagonistic Chinese spy balloons.  The stigma behind #ChineseVirus punched a giant hole in the CCP rhetoric the fat kid that runs that country couldnt handle. No apology or admission of guilt.
The China doll is upset is he. #TrudeauDestroyingCanada
I believe the missiles are actually called "Oriental born candy sticks"  That way we don't panic when they hit our air space.  Trudeau is vacationing that day of course.
. Would've be surprised if we get missiles sent our way from Russia, made in China !!  .
📡The CCP's history of Stealing, Buying, and Spying on America's Military. Last week a Chinese spy Balloon dominated the news on Twitter. The Balloon traveled from China, to Alaska, Canada, and was first spotted in Billings Montana by citizens, a few 100 Miles from a ICBM site https://t.co/AJxqgIooEy
In 2022, Former CIA agent Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67, was arrested after a sting operation in which he allegedly accepted cash from an undercover FBI agent and said he wanted the “motherland” to succeed, prosecutors said.
In 2013 The catastrophic data breach of the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM), exposed personal information of more than 22 million current and former GOVERNMENT employees. This wasn't known until 2015. It took another 15 months for Congress to complete a report on it
Among the evidence of the OMP Hack is the fact that PlugX, the backdoor tool installed on OPM's network, is associated with Chinese-language hacking groups that have attacked political activists in Hong Kong and Tibet; the use of superhero names is also tied to the Chinese Group
In 2013 Israel was caught selling elector-optics (Spy) tech to China. The head of Israeli Defense Ministry resigned over this. Very little information can be found about this Treason from Israel, A nation that gladly accepts Billions in support from the United States.
in 2009 the CCP stole the design for the F-35 fighter to help China build a knockoff fighter the Shenyang FC-31. The F-35 was the costliest weapons program in U.S. history at the time, intending to build 2,450 of the aircraft at the cost of $400 Billion in 2013 money.
In 1993, Israel Was caught selling 3 Billion (Over 6 Billion today) in Hi-Tech Military Equipment to China. Tech included Air To Air Missile, and Jet info. "The CIA told the committee the Chinese were seeking from Israel technologies that Western firms were unwilling to provide."
Today China has openly started a water war with India, builds bases in the South China sea to threaten other Asian countries, and sees the US as it's only competitor. Chinese Bots are also active on twitter  sowing doubt on China's crimes.
The Balloon story is not a distraction, and represents the biggest threat to the United States since the Cuban Missie Crisis. Anyone who tells you differently is being very dishonest about the History of Chinese aggression against the United States Military.
There was also one spotted in Latin America, somewhat close to Panama Canal. A strategic area in wartime.  The 4 subsequent drones our govs shot down to "protect" citizens? Cover. To distract and muddy topic around China-Pentagon collusion.
That 1st balloon seemed designed to spy on US assets in Guam, maybe Hawaii -- but weather currents sent it way north to Alaska &amp; beyond.  Rare time when teams up with intel experts for big scoop.   https://t.co/qONbIcesUC
Finally, some geopolitical analysis.
This is so interesting. If true, we made the most of their mishap and gained a lot of intel.
AmI allowed to say I follow you all?
Yeah let's make excuses now
Proud of my capital weather gang!
Interesting
Biden ran on being a geopolitical grandmaster. The Vulcans era GOP would be chewing him up. This is an early 2024 opportunity for a Trump opponent to show the party and independents he/she "has it".
Goddamn paywall on stories of national importance again.  Way to limit information so that people have to scramble to find free sources and scour through conspiracy theories.  Well done modern news journalism! 
yeah right and it "drifted" over all of out sensitive strategic points too with propellers on it. fucking toddler level of propaganda is horrid.
Just like the US, China has 300 satellites, a third of which can read the names on gravestones from space and listen to ANY conversation anywhere. "Spy" balloons not needed.  It sure makes for great childlike US propaganda to start World War III though. The US is aching for war.
lol, no, it's actually a win for china, it proved to the whole world that while china welcomed muslims from all over the world to xinjiang, western countries are shutting off a muslim uyghur from xinjiang bc it's not convenient to their false narrative.
Dear President Biden:  Please quit shooting down U.S. weather balloons to minimize your gross neglect in letting China spy on Americans from coast to coast at minimum and put their lives at risk maximum. Thank you.  Sincerely, U.S. National Weather Service.
sorry guys i accidentally let go of the balloons from my gender reveal party and now i've increased tensions between the united states and china
the gender is [         ] so that's why the balloons look like that
tfw you got the ken RT so you have 100x the interactions you usually do
Can you speak on the number of balloons and how much gender was in them?
69. 0 gender just hot air
It happens to the best of us
These two are auditioning to be one of the next spy balloons from China. https://t.co/i7OhKrQNAH
Be careful or Stacy will eat you! .  .
There were no #Aliens. No space ships. Just different balloons and craft either sent by hostile governments to spy, like China's, or put up there by our own government as a distraction from oh, I don't know,  Nord Stream? Pfizer? Chickens? The border? Train derailments? War? etc
Would like to make you a believer if only knew how
NEW: U.S. tracked China spy balloon from launch on Hainan island along unusual path - and me  https://t.co/ObbkoMZE6c
Liars! Why didn’t they intercept it before it entered US airspace or the US defense zone? They could have scrambled their F-22s then. They are embarrassed and are now trying to placate a restless GOP following. Shameful.
If true, our government chose to put millions at risk.
Please. Is this revealing classified information?
The real America without balloons.
Shame that the previous #republican #Trump Government never discovered these #ChinaSpyBalloon's. Or were they comprimised?
Who is the biggest spy now?
An article from the 2019: 'Pentagon testing mass surveillance balloons across the US' Was recent events really a product of China, or could it be closer to home? #ChineseSpyBallon https://t.co/B7ZRoWDxZY
When this was happening they were all spewing bullshit about a spy balloon from China..... They could've been reporting about a catastrophic event happening in Ohio. Instead of using our tax dollars to help the people of East Palestine Ohio &amp; their neighbors.  The shot a balloon.
All these railroad guys going on strike saying this shit isn't right.... They're overworked, new guys are undertrained... They don't have sick leave... This is what's gonna happen if we don't get those guys some help!
Meanwhile they're lining politicians pockets instead of taking care of their employees. They need to be shut down and investigated..... Disgusting
BREAKING: John Kirby doubles down on claim that 3 balloons flew over the U.S. under when asked to respond to John Bolton pushing back against that claim. "All we're doing is speak the truth," he said without providing any evidence. He's speaking at a… https://t.co/0EsJ8zLGTy
Anyone who remembers this guy from the Obama years knows what a lying weasel he is.
He's a pure dirtbag. A disgrace to the Naval Officer Corp
Love it!
They are not believable. Anyway!
Great work Mr. Ateba. You're a rare shining light among your peers.
What we care about is right now. The whataboutism is not for our national security.
Wag the dog. Everything they say is a lie. Everything they do serves themselves.
And your "service" is any different?
A lot different
No it's not. It's simply statements that serve noone except your self, so ...
Typical politician answer of, "Yeah but the other guy"
He does realize the military and air defense systems don’t change from admin to admin right?
#OhioTrainDisaster #EastPalestineOH
How would he know if they were undiscovered?  Obviously a lie.
He is a paid, professional liar.
If true, why wasn't Trump informed?
Statements without proof are in fact, LIES!
All lies
They already said they didn’t inform the President.
Show us where President Trump ordered the Military to stand down.
He’s lying again, as usual.  If that had really happened, they would’ve been out with that on every single network.
Kirby has the position he has because he's a seasoned liar.
So how do they know if nobody knew?
If it is said from that podium, it is false.
Is it wrong that I had to watch twice and laughed hysterically both times
He’s a f-k’ing liar
These clowns have no answer for their embarrassment, so they just revert back to Trump.  This administration is a joke.
Cause he is lying. It’s already been proven that if it happened Trump was not told. Cause we all know if Trump knew China would of paid dearly
Admiral Kirby says what he's instructed to say. The fact that he's not quite the fumbling, inarticulate, condescending, in-over-her-head, dependent-on-the-briefing-book, Shatterer of Glass Ceilings KJ-P has prompted some to crown him Master of the Briefing Room. 
Map shows near Guam and near Hawaii and near Puerto Rico.    But then not clear if international or territorial boundaries.  Also showed at least three others in last two years under Biden.     Again no details/pictures of what they really were.
Who's the lady in red?  Is she the "sign language" person?
It's easy to say stuff when you don't have to prove it.
LMFAO still blaming Trump for their shortcomings, cringe.
He's lying. Even those in the know about such things that are vehemently against President DJT have come out against the lies that Kirby is spewing.
Where's the evidence  Hunter said he saw them 
I see that Lil Miss Canadia appears as if she's struck speachless!
The balloons were undetectable back then, however we have detected them now posthumously.
We are talking about now today not about Trump. He is not around to be your scapegoat fetish
Rent free
Sounds a bit like that Adam Schiff guy.
Then it’s a horrible indictment that, if true, the DoD didn’t inform the Commander in Chief!!!
“Speaking truth” …
Zero credibility ...
Since when has anyone representing this administration spoken the truth?
What I didn't hear him say is Trump knew about them..
KJP sure does look unhappy. Why, oh why, does that put a smile on my face?
All they do is lie
This administration lies, all day, every day. When called out, they say “Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia”.
Lies &amp; deceit woke away
Liar.  If that had really  happened, they wouldn't have waited until the first Chinese balloon showed up to talk about it.  They're ALWAYS looking for a gotcha, and if it had happened, they'd be ON it in early Biden days.
Show the receipts home boy
Lying!
Nothing that comes from this administration is “truth”.  Not one syllable.
They often put out a lie for the media to run with so by the time the truth finally comes out the damage of the lie has already been done
We know it isn’t true. If one balloon had entered our airspace during DJT and he didn’t take the appropriate action, we would have heard about it nonstop from all his haters! And we know Xi wouldn’t have attempted it under DJT. After 2 years of lies, why believe this admin.
Exactly what I said,  they would use any opportunity to gaslight him.  I don't believe it at all.
Remember when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor under Trump?
Saying it is so does not make it so.
Need to see the data on that one Kirby
The way they hate(d) him, it would have been shoved down our throats for 6 years....
More lies and disinformation what else do you expect from this administration??
Lies and more lies
He’s lying because, his mouth is moving!
Assertions made without substantiation can be dismissed on the same basis. There is no evidence.
Why is he allowed to get away with this? Prove it!
Do you find it convenient that after Biden is criticized for his response that miraculously, they figured out how to detect the undetectable from years past.   Question:  What made them look? (Other than deflection).
Be their "William Phips" and reject the "spectral evidence"
They were undetected.....
He's speaking the truth about something that NEVER HAPPENED... #JoeBidenIsAFailure
If there were, it was probably just another thing Milley and the other traitorous higher-ups hid.
This is all I see when Kirby is on the screen
John Kirby after declaring once more his disdain for having to come into the office, reminded Americans that “…no the Balloons were not a deliberate distraction while we cover up more of this government’s crimes.”
Source: Trust me bro 
They want to blame Trump years later, this is a sick administration.
They want a classified meeting to say that they met with Trump officials, but being classified they can not disclose any info. A purely clear cut lie.
I hope you know these guys are nothing but a bunch of filthy dirty liars
John Kirby and the truth don’t know each other.
Which means it is all lies
He needs to answer where and for how long.  Spy balloons momentarily entering US airspace is different than traversing across the entire nation.  If they were in US airspace for extended periods of time, why were the appropriate members of the Trump Administration not informed?
He knows if happened when Trump was in office there would be pics and videos to show with millions of people watching the skies. And they have nothing. And after this post they will scramble to make and edit some to say they have some.
He says nobody was aware of them, and then he complains that the Trump administration did nothing about objects that nobody knew anything about.  Mr Kirby is as daffy as KJP and their boss in the White House.
If that’s true. He just threw Miley n Maddis under the bus . Has connected them to the CCP
I love when they speak the truth..
So it's Donald Trump's "fault" there are Chinese balloons floating over the United States. Of course The White House would blame this on him.
John Kirby is the LIAR’S LIAR as are all the LIARS in the pseudo administration. FULL STOP
Everything that comes from the WH is a lie.
Stretching the truth, if it was so the Dems would have been all over DJT about allowing.
It should have been public knowledge if it happened and when it happened.  You cannot convince me it happened at all.  No pilot reports, civilians on the grounds, airline passengers, air traffic controllers, NORAD?  Wait.  Was the evidence in all those classified docs Biden had?
It’s absolutely CRIMINAL what and the are doing to the American people right now…
Then speak the FULL truth. It was already revealed that President Trump wasn't informed about the balloons during his presidency.
We all know there would have been a third impeachment proceeding if it had happened, it would have been all over the primaries to show failure as well.
how the hell does he know they flew over the US during the Trump administration if they went undetected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So he’s still saying that they looked back in the past and detected 3 undetectable balloons that they now detect.
I’m old enough to remember Afghanistan in August 2021….I don’t trust anything he says…
Where’s the proof….
If this is true why wasn’t the Trump administration informed?  Is intelligence going rouge?  Where’s the evidence?
Question is Simon if they were undetected how would he know about them, other than its a lie.
“Truth?”  Lol.  Kirby and the Haitian don’t know how to tell the truth.  If they did, Joey would be in shackles.
When did Kirby get access to a Time Machine and get the ability to go back in time to check balloons? The entire Biden admin is nothing but liars.
He said three balloons went undetected during the Trump White House! So if they were undetected how do they know?
Kirby is deep state. They’re not Chinese balloons. They know EXACTLY what they are. But choose instead to use terms like UAPs. They are  Cosmospheres. High altitude craft that use earth’s electromagnetic field to stay aloft in perpetuity. Been in existence since the 50s.
When backed into a corner, blame trump . Pathetic
WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN BLOWING UP NORDSTREAM!!!  The balloons are a distraction.
NO EVIDENCE.
Where's the proof
Nobody saw them, but they were there! 
This administration is packed with liars!! These two are both liars
Both of them serial liars and can’t be trusted!  Someone needs to show demonstrative evidence whether this is accurate!! Enough with the cheap talk prove it
Always blaming Trump for their own evil deeds. Pathetic losers.
Why is it always the Republicans or Trumps fault.
I have no more trust in this administration.  None.
So they lied to the president.. treason
So, they are literally confirming deep state collusion that kept critical intel from former president. Nice. The installed current president will allow those really running the country to continue to run the country - the unelected intellocrats.
Anyone else raising the "BS Flag" on this?  He stated yesteray that there 3 seperate instances of balloons entering US airspace  under the previous administratoin but they were able to detect them...but we were.  How is that exactly?  Doesn't even make sense.
So he's saying they hid intel from the man they work for...anybody else see a problem with that?
Truth 
I don’t think anyone in the Biden administration, including Biden, even know what it means to tell the truth.
Just happened to discover this 2 years later, I don't think so!
Speak the truth? 
If Trump wasn't impeached for it, it didn't happen. 
I felt more secure under Trump, so what is your point?  If you knew about this and failed to reveal,  then you are the problem!
Is this guy lying again
How do they know what happened then, if we didn't know then? But somehow we know now. The words don't make sense.
Well they're trying to take credit for acting on the first balloon after it was in the airspace for over a week. They only acted days after the public started posting pictures. I don't think they discovered anything, the public did.
No pictures, no documents, no reports..... 
Prove it
If 3 balloons flew over Trump’s America why in the hell are we just finding about it now.  He, His staff and cabinet members were not told at the time.  Why not?
Listening to Kirby and Blinken speak about shooting unknown objects out of the sky sounded suspiciously like they were sending a veiled threat to I'm 100% wrong... but Elon should keep his eyes on the sky, and draft a few lawsuits just in case.
The look on Corrinne Jean-Pierre "At least I don't have to answer the tough questions about balloons and stuff"
How tf did they retroactively find the balloons under Trump if they didn’t find them back then?
Biden spokesperson and truth……….ain’t buying it.
I LOVED the bit where he tried to stop himself from saying that Biden takes Balloons very seriously (because KJP has only said that in response to the docs scandal).
Its true because I said so
What dates did those 2 balloons fly?  Can he specify?  .... We doubt it.
“All we’re doing is speaking the truth”?   like anyone in this administration knows how to do that?!  Good grief!
I do not believe anything that comes out of his mouth is worth my time.  He has proven himself to be a liar.
That would be a first because John has never told the truth.
So apparently, definition has changed to  “truth” is whatever they say.
Old news. Balloons are a distraction anyway.
Apparently a cloud hovered over my home in 2018. I didn't detect it. But the people who bought my home in 2021 assure me that it was there.
And the dirty DOD and FBI never told the last Administration. They should be charged with treason and insubordination.
More lies
Prove it
He speaks the lies. That's what they do...all the time. #Liars
His lies should get him fired !
So that means the pentagon officials lied and kept them from trump which mean y’all are corrupt but we all already knew this.
Kirby lies
Baghdad Bob would be so proud of Kirby.
Rihanna at the White House now ?! The superbowl disaster wasn’t enough ?!
How does he know if they weren’t detected?
Kirby "Trust Me Bro"
Speaking truth? Now that’s a new one!
In both cases , it's duty of US Armed forces .
He is a liar. This administration is hiding something BIG
There is no truth to be had coming from the Whitehouse
That’s good enough for Biden voters 
He's lying. That simple
John Bolton is no friend of Trump's...in fact, they despise one another. He has no reason to say anything that would help Trump if it weren't true.
No evidence, then Im not convinced.  Besides, as HRC would say, “what difference does it make anyway?!”
Kirby lost his credibility with that statement. My take is that he’s blaming NORAD during the Trump administration for not doing their job.
Let's say the balloons did fly over the U.S. when Trump was president and they never found them.  Then how does Mr. Kirby know the balloons existed?  Who was tracking those balloons and never told the government about them?  I call him a liar!!!
These lies are the truth this time, honest!
I believe him. He said he was speaking the truth, his truth are lies... One thing means the other, good is evil evil is good. When they say one thing they mean the opposite. We now live in Bizarro world.
It is all a lie!
The adult version of “I know you are, but what am I?”
Why doesn’t anyone ask him what proof they have instead of talking points. I want to see the proof!
Once again, detecting objects that cross our borders is the military's responsibility. Are they saying that the military under Donald Trump was less competent 2 years ago? After all, it was a civilian, not superior US tech or spit-shined military, that spotted the China balloon.
Truth and democrat not related
What a liar Kirby is.
Show me the proof Joe
If this true then our government was with holding info from the commander and chief and those responsible need to be rooted out of the government…… Treason!!
Just another lying government stooge reassigning blame to deflect to others what is way to uncomfortable for them to admit
Often times when the higher ups tell people they don’t know they really just don’t know either
Nothing changes. It's always the same.
Why must there always be a comparison to Trump? Just deal with what we are facing now instead of wasting so much time comparing with the past. Tired of listening to them focusing more on comparing than providing possible solutions for the here and now!
With spy satellites that can see the toes on a mouse from space, the Chinese are using spy balloons? 🤔 Just sayin 🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂😂😂 #NORAD #China #ChinaSpyBalloon https://t.co/s0xbmr1l57
the whole world WANTS the "us balloons" to protect them from the NASTY likes of the ccp in china!
UPDATE: NATO believes unidentified balloons over US are manifestation of increased intelligence from China and Russia - Stoltenberg.
Paranoia really setting in, balloons FFS, getting to a stage where our western leaders incapable of rational thinking, god help us,
Since May last year,the US has released multiple high-altitude balloons from its territory,which have continuously circled the globe and flown over the airspace of China &amp; several dozen other countries over ten times illegally at least without the approval of Chinese authorities. https://t.co/DsmmIeghqs
As China is such a security threat, why do we have a Chancellor of the Exchequer whose Chinese wife works for the Chinese state broadcaster and MPs who receive money from Chinese agents? Who needs balloons? https://t.co/r4RzbOckoD
EXCLUSIVE: U.S. tracked China spy balloon from launch on Hainan Island along unusual path by w/ CWG's Weather model from helped Wash Post simulate the balloon's bath. Full article: https://t.co/oydx1FsNzP (1/x) https://t.co/WtBKvG8ulV

Would China be sending spy balloon after spy balloon if they hadn't seen Biden, Harris and Fetterman?  Would Putin be in Ukraine if he hadn't seen Biden, Harris and Fetterman?  Of course not  NENA | 99 Red Balloons [1984]  https://t.co/zePc3QXxVI via
I guess the cat is out of the bag!  The fat lady has sung.  China Balloons are everywhere and Trump never was informed about it from General Milley!  I guess Treason runs deep in the DEMONRAT party!  The Swamp is a bottomless pit in DC! https://t.co/w3LGPIQ8oE
A train carrying toxic chemicals derailed and ignited a fire in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3, setting off evacuation orders and a federal investigation. Now there are worries about the environment and transportation network.  Here's what we know. https://t.co/NAHYNj40qH https://t.co/40JLQCXNPd
How long will it take for Republicans to blame this on Joe Biden and/or Pete Buttigieg?  Starting now 5-4-3-2-1
impressive resume
Zero of what you showed is truthful
Truth hurts doesn’t it
Because it’s not truthful. You cant be a Republican and fight government overreach then claim when it fails to push it on the feds.   All of it was created by the private companies first. You should start there. Self accountability right?
You can’t have both.  Baby formula was created by the CEO. They didn’t do the necessary maintenance and it cost lives. They bought shares back instead.   That decision had zero todo with the government. That’s on you list lies.
No, you’re turning your head away from the truth that under a Republican president and a Republican Governor, rail regulations were loosened that led to the disaster unfolding.   Dewine has not asked the federal government for help which he has to do. Chain of command.
Yet it happened under the Biden Administrations watch and not under Trump... LOL
Finally, it is reported!!! Yay!
Wasn't this a movie
This is a China style coverup.
Holy shit, 10 days ago? I thought this happened over the weekend. wtf? Why hasn't this been covered til now?
Remember what goes up will fall down over time or get carried in the wind. So, my question, can't the residents sue the train company for harm and damages? Like or is the government gonna bail that company out?
Weather here in the greater Detroit area changed direction since Ohio train chemical explosion. It has been unusually warm. I wonder if the Ohio train explosion is a legit correlation?
Can't wait to see these replies.
This happened February 3 and you're reporting on it now. Why is that?
Reporting on it 10 days later?
your report left out the root causes of this disaster: coordinated and consistent erosion of safety regulations at the hands of rail companies enjoying record profits
Why isn’t the media covering this???!!!
Seems like the head of transportation should be talking about it.  Instead:
Is mayor Pete still on maternity leave?
It didn't "catch fire", it was detonated.
This happened over a week ago. Why didn’t you report on it when it was fresh?
Wow.  Looks like a scene from White Noise that’s coming out on Netflix .  Check out YouTube clips
:Even in hell, Ohioans would puff their chests with pride if they looked up at the track of an F-22 chasing a balloon.
Thoughts and prayers
Very timely news 
today is Feb 13. you should have been on this massive ecological disaster Feb 3.
NYT had to wait until they got the “ok” from the White House to give a sanitized version
What about the train in Houston.
about time you’re reporting on this
Here you're at almost-two-week long last at NYT! Better late than never…
Couldnt ignore it and hide it from the public anymore huh boys?
You just NOW report on this???
I live 15 miles away from there.
Ya’ll finally on the scene?
Why did it take you ten days to cover this…
A week later 
Now there are worries?  This happened how long ago and just got reported in the NYT?
Finally covering this story. Congrats.
What took you so long
Interesting coincidence, with all the talk about the US Air force shooting down UFOs. Didn't the military in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind also use the excuse of a train derailment to empty a large area of people so they can proceed with their alien thing?
Finally, The New York Times.  These people are being lied to.
Where's the WH on all this? Bizarre silence
No accident
Praying for your safety, so sorry this is happening.
Toxic chemicals pouring into the Ohio River, which pours into the Mississippi River is catastrophic, peeps!
WOW! Look! The mainstream news is on this very concerning story!
Late to the party much? And, still not a full report. Who are you really protecting?
White Noise
Better late than never 'news'
100，000gallon of vinyl chloride and tons of dioxins were generated from the explosion and released to the air
The fire was intentionally set as I understand it...
....10 days later
Hey everybody!  Breaking news from February 3rd!
Ohio poisoned water and air... hmmm if only there was a government agency their state wasn't actively dismantling...
A week and a half late! Why’d you stop covering it up with the rest of the media. Twitter force your hand?
10 days fk'g late.
Glad you covered this.  I hope to see more balanced news from you
That's it? That's all you know? 10 days after the fact?  Is this the New York Times or just a Wendy's?  Ffs 
Wasn't this just a movie on Netflix?
10 days and this story is finally gaining traction.  The American media at work folks
The fact you took so longer to cover this story only proves how shady and corrupt the is. When you’re not pushing false narratives and fake news your suppressing facts to protect your regime.
So it happened almost 2 weeks ago and you have posted it now?
“There are worries”? Babes, please
Buttigieg - Diversity Hire. Will not be blamed.
10 days
Why isn’t the White House talking about this?
A week old story is NOT news.  The NEWS is that the MSM has not said boo before today.
White noise the movie. Everyone look it up lol
You're 10 days late. How much money did Norfolk southern pay to get this delayed?
Nice of you to chime in only 10 days late oh “paper of record”…….  Did you get permission from the oligarchs to finally report on it?
Thanks for reporting on this like a week plus later.
wait i thought the MSM was covering this up
Hey only 10 days late, good job
When you think about the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and the GOP's tepid response, keep in mind that the Trump Administration did what railroad lobbyists wanted the most.  They repealed an Obama Administration safety rule for trains with hazardous chemicals.
We have the worst rail system on the planet. No investment since the 1900’s.
Took you guys long enough
Someone covered up the burn pit. There's no discussion about how materials moved or removed from the site. They rebuilt the railroad track to get rail going on the site of the burn pit.  Show one test of human impact of exposure to that train cocktail? There is none.
So you finally barely started to report this disaster 10 days after it happened! While you spent hours reporting a big boi and there are hundreds in the US air space which you chose to ignore in the past two decades.
Where’s the Sec Transportation?? Haven’t heard a word……too busy looking for evil overpasses I guess.
Wasnt that like 10 days ago? Did you walk there from NY?
I'm happy that the NY Times has finally been shamed into covering this story.
How pathetic is this, 10 days. Amazing job.
Ignited?? I was led to believe it was torched on purpose.
Cool how it took ten days for you to report on this.
The NYT reported this on Feb 4th: Train Derailment in Ohio Sparks Huge Fire and Prompts Evacuations
#Exposome by train
An accident of this magnitude takes place in the United States at the beginning of February and the national and international media have not disclosed anything.
Took you guys a while to discover the biggest environmental disaster the US has seen in a while - why
Love how this is 10 days after the fact
Over a week ago and your are JUST now reporting on it? Once again, the NYTimes is embarrassingly late to the party.
It’s only a literal cloud of death, and anything that flies, walks or swims is dying.  I’m sure it’s fine.
Yes. We knew. Thanks
Little late to the party, comrades.
Kind remind: Today is Feb. 14. Happy Valentines Day!
Why wasn’t this front page news earlier?
Didn't we see this movie already?
TEN DAYS AGO
But the EPA said that there are “hundreds and hundreds” of data points that the air is perfectly fine 
Yeah it’s eerie a 1984 novel about a train crash causing a ‘toxic airborne event’ was made into a movie filmed by where it ended up happening. But book was about a confluence of media &amp; hyper-capitalism poisoning America.   And last year rail workers 100% predicted this disaster. twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/…
Environment and transportation? How about the humans? It’s freaking vinyl chloride. 
Those Israeli military land grabbers... Oh wait
Only took you 10 days to say something. Absolutely pathetic. 
Now you’re covering this story? Enoree, SC and Houston, TX derailments should also be covered, and not 10 days later
Why are you that close lol
A bit late on getting the news out 2/3. And this is the 13th.
10 days ago!!!! Come on we need better coverage!
10 days ago... msm is a joke
What took ya’ll so long??
Really!? Well. Your editor is well selected. I'm sure the top investors in Norfolk Southern were consulted. You know. The real players in the global economy
3rd world imperial #America blew trillions in the middle east, now domestic infrastructure is falling apart LOLOL #PalestineOhio
File this with the recent Keystone pipeline oil spill in Kansas - stories that get nowhere near the coverage they should. Can’t imagine ($$$$) why.
Medias didn’t even mention it was the official decision to burn the vinyl chloride, and the burnt vinyl chloride produces dioxin which is a strong carcinogen will be absorbed by skin, water, soil and drifted into air. They just said there are health and environmental impacts hmmm
The george Santos delay
“Now there are worries about the environment…” ? JUST NOW?
Finally getting around to this one, huh?
You guys are right on top of things…Feb 3rd?
Who'd of thought eh and at same time so called weather balloon went by...
It's wasn't by the accident that ignited it, authorities did a controlled burn to avoid an explosion. thank them for the toxic clouds.
They lobbied for relaxed safety standards and it bit them in the ass. They will continue to do so.
Where have you been???  This happened DAYS AGO!!!!!!
Really ,now ? Were u busy with the coverup?
Worries?
Took you long enough
Jesus!! About freaking time. Some ace reporting there.
10 days later.....
Knowing what vinyl chloride is, it was obvious that this will be a huge environmental disaster and a great health risk to anyone within miles of the site. I’m confounded at how little media attention this was given
Criminal!
Better late than never, huh NYTs?
People are asking how come it took you so long to report on NEWS THIS IMPORTANT YOU ALL ARE TAKING TO LONG TO ANSWER. TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVESTOCK AND FAMILY PETS TOO
BUT BUT BUT it's safer than a pipeline..RIGHT A PIPE LINE THAT ISOLATION VALVES RIGHT.. WHISSSSHHHH THERE GOES THE EASTER BUNNY WITH THE TOOTH FAIRY RIDING ON IT'S BACK..
ik this is off topic but if you can’t break bread you fake $4Luxv2
They blew it up from what I hear
Finally!
Took 10 days to write this! Yikes! Give this the attention it deserves.
10 days to report this, way to go guys
This has taken so long I literally went to your profile to see if you’re not a Times parody account.
Can’t cover it up any longer?
Thanks for (finally) giving some national coverage.
They'll hide it like they did the covid people dying
This was 10 days ago and the NYT is just now reporting on it ???
Huh... What's today's date?
Where are those burned (and toxic) railroad cars going to end up?? There are way too many questions and not near rough answers.
Way to get on this story 10 days late because of pressure from social media. Paper of record. No notes.
Lmao the new york times everyone almost 2 weeks later
Only in Ohio
This should have been hot off the press. You have the responsibility to inform people of important events.
Where is Greta and the Hollywood cult ?  Biden covering up for his railroad union buddies.
Just cause got super viral, right?
its 2/13/23
such transport must be banned.  This will have devastating long time effects
Profits of people
It took you 10 days to finally come through.
The rail company put massive profits ahead of safety.
Wow and now are you reporting it???? 10 days later??????
Feb 3!! Keep reporting on this
I finally see the report.
What took you so long?
I only heard the one at Chicago Heights, this is new
A Little late to the party?
What took you so long.
PS- it’s February 13. Why the 10 day delay reporting about this catastrophe?
And where is
This took… awhile.
It has been covered up by the mainstream media for  10 days.
Feb. 3!!!!!!!!!
More interested on what you are hiding maybe
Wow! It took 10 days to realize torching 1 million pounds or so of carcinogens into the sky would cause an ecological disaster and harm tons of people
Gifted article.
Where the hell was this reporting when it HAPPENED?
Finally figured out you couldn’t avoid reporting on this?!
B̶u̶e̶l̶l̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶B̶u̶e̶l̶l̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶B̶u̶e̶l̶l̶e̶r̶ Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg?
Bout damn time
The residents are being told the water is safe to drink. The chemicals are only on the surface.
What's with all the "finally reported!" comments when they can easily be proven wrong? No issues with saying "it should have been reported more" though ...
Who is John Gault?
Holy fuck, is this a news media outlet actually covering this story?
Good choice from "the light of humanity", burn it instead of covering it with soil.Good choice.
You clowns finally woke up. Lol
Who’s going to jail? Why do we punish poor people for stealing bread and resources to live but these criminals who are ruining the world won’t spend a day behind bars?
Wait, how many days ago?
Finally, more than a week later
Took you long enough.......
Finally you are informing about this!
10 days later
10 days late NYT.  No wonder people love Tik Tok over main media.
Exclusive: The U.S. tracked the Chinese spy balloon a week before shooting it down off the coast of South Carolina. The Chinese surveillance device may have been diverted on an errant path caused by unusual weather conditions. https://t.co/ESXLKthHhg
Ordered a big romantic balloon from China to fly over my house as a valentines treat for my partner but it’s not turned up…
Boom boom
That's the distant noise I heard, yes.
Same happened to me for a gender reveal party last week.
Assume you got a fly past instead?
Based on latest information, ***all meetings*** between Xinjiang's governor and EU / British officials are now cancelled.  This is the most significant propaganda setback for Beijing re Xinjiang in some time.
you disgust me, so this is what you do to a real Uyghur who asks you a question.
Zenz at this stage has to be the most debunked US CIA funded propagandist on the planet, never been to China can't read speak Chinese, each propaganda piece he throws out gets debunked in days sometimes minutes, CIA BBC etc pay him well
CIA hired clowns who never speak with evidence or logic
Now they are attacking the Chinese Internet in an attempt to guide public opinion
做贼心虚。。。
This is genocide. Ask your dad about his role in this.
Half expecting China to come out and accuse the EU &amp; GB of orchestrating genocide in Xinjiang.
The picture in the article is an actual prison, not a ‘concentration camp’.
Grayzone has done extensive unpacking and analysts on claims made by ASPI and Adrian Zenz.  The 1 million Uyghurs concentration camp Methodology is in this article. Based on an extrapolation from a sample size of 8 interviews.
Those who claim to defend Uyghurs are the attacking Uyghurs
Can you explain the source of that infamous photo and why the bottom right hand corner is cropped? 
Ah you are back out ...yet you still want to propogate the lie... debunked...boring...not going anywhere...no one believes it anymore...
Adrian, Son of Beelzebub, grandson of Lucifer. Do you seriously believe that you are the hand of war between men molded by Ares?
You are definitely the most shameless person I've ever seen. After your lies have been debunked so many times you still have the nerve to tweet about XJ.
they care more about goods from xinjiang are still in the west market。
Mr. ZENZ... any new and authentic photos? No, there are none. It's a farce
Adrian trying to hard to maintain any sort of relevance. Maybe it's time for some. New bogus reporting. I hear the US state dept pays well for that.
Weren't you already debunked as a cristo-fascist fraud?
Lol that headline was funny  pure comedy
Xinjiang will never change because of your views and positions. Xinjiang is China's Xinjiang, and the Uighurs in Xinjiang are also Chinese citizens, and have nothing to do with you.
Hallo Herr Zenz, Ich sehe Ihre Tweets seit lange Zeit nicht mehr, da Ihre Tweets nicht alle Ihre Followers    erreichbar sind.   Vermutlich hat Twitter  eingeschränkt.
Stop east Germany Nazis concentration camps and genocides in East Russia  cccp occupied Xinjiang!
The only propaganda setback that exits in the factual real world (something unhinged fundamentalists like you do not understand) is that it's widely known that you are literally paid by the US national security state to fabricate evidence against China, and you are bad at it.
You are such a pathetically incompetent propaganda hack that the only people who pay attention to your Twitter feed are CPC supports who like to make fun of it, you swivel-eyed loon.   Adrian Zenz is the George Santos of US foreign policy.
Are you still on a god-given mission against "the CCP"?
Excellent. Why would  waste time on talking with rabid sinophobes like yourself, to sanctimoniously be lectured on human rights by a bunch of hypocrites who imprison journalists like J. Assange, kill people with inhumane sanctions, ie. Syria, and arm the genocidal Saudis?
Take a look at your own prisons
Germans are liars they are evil and so mean. you Adrian Zenz deserve to go to hell.
White supremacists like you are now trying to discriminate against the uyghur !
good i don’t c the point for this meeting either. like who gives a s**t about the british these days lol
Who do you seriously believe?  A German "scholar" who has never set foot in Xinjiang,  OR  Two separate Islamic delegations consisting of various nationalities that visited Xinjiang in the last 12 months to investigate those claims made by Zen and his puppet masters? 
white should be quiet.. real muslim has spoken
How much money does the U.S. government give you to smear Xinjiang and China every day? I give you double money to go beat Biden up.
American disinformation triumphs again!
Adiran zenz needs to be arrested for promoting anti Chinese hate crime
#stopuyghurgenocide
once again the stinkies stinking together
#JailTheGenociderAlready
you claim this evidence of genocide? lmfao
propaganda talk balloons while Ohio burns human rights the issue in China? US should attend to problems at home. Blackrock, the war profitteer, has just sacrificed Ohio with that train derailment. Broken Unions Degregulation Capitalism destroys the world Stop pointing the finger.
You are a shameless liar, should go straight to hell.
Why the West are so afraid to hear what the Xinjiang governor has to say ? The Xinjiang governor is also Uyghur, so it could very interesting to hear what he has to say. Are you afraid of the truth ? Are you afraid that what he might say will go against your narrative?
How is is bad for China?xinjiang is a Chinese province,why would the Chinese government want representatives of the colonial power to mess in its internal affairs?keep them out!and complain at the UN about the British illegal colonial occupation of the malvinas (aka falklands)
Have you considered actually listening to WHY they cancelled? The chinese have literally said: Because the US/NATO are behaving like deluded maniacs; lying about silly balloons, lying about Ukraine, lying about Syria, lying about Palestine, lying about their intentions.
I think a Europe openly subordinated to Washington, arming and backing actual Nazis in Ukraine, not wanting to meet with you is a good thing, not a "setback."  It's also a wake up call - Western govs do not act in good faith. twitter.com/adrianzenz/sta…
FRAUD
This is not a setback for the Chinese. But it is a huge setback for the EU/UK. Pretending that you care about the Uyghurs is just gross.
Imam Zenz hate Xinjiang Uyghur as they are not practicing Islam according to his version of Islam. Allahuakhbar.
Thank you for exemplifying cancel culture.
you are just a wanker, degrading, so mean, evil little man. Germany is so evil in making a colossal lie. Fuxck you
Give it up NED sponsored Nazi!
Will you please eat shit you lousy bum!  China is a better country than the (RACIST) hole you are living  in.
You as a German literally wrote a book about mass Jewish deaths at the Imminent Rupture. U psycho
"Parts [were] made in America that were put on a spy balloon from China," Rep Michael McCaul says.  "I don't think the American people accept that."  https://t.co/KYRt1wlvt9
It's remarkable that almost everything we buy, wear and have in our homes is Made in China, and yet the Chinese Spy Baloon had Made in America parts - not good 
Most of our aircraft have at least some parts made in China.
Well if nothing else that's a change usually everything comes from China but since they're in collusion who knows what's really going on.
The corrupt phoney admin is in collusion with china. How they cheated.
Just like the Wuhan flu, this may be just another "joint operation"... Everyone keeps leaving that observation out.....
Many, many, many things sold in America are made in China. That, too, is unacceptable. 
What’s most concerning is that bozo Biden allowed this thing to travel across the United States gathering information before he did anything. He only did something because the American public could see the balloon. We have an incompetent liar for a president. What a mess
We all know Biden is compromised
This matters because why?
McCaul was for Nafta. McAuley is for amnesty. He's a snake
Parts made in America that were put on a Chinese balloon or an American balloon that was said to be from China? Occam's razor.
Wow Biden Administration is not telling Americans anything
That 1st balloon seemed designed to spy on US assets in Guam, maybe Hawaii -- but weather currents sent it way north to Alaska &amp; beyond.  Rare time when teams up with intel experts for big scoop.   https://t.co/qONbIcesUC
“By the time the Chinese spy balloon crossed into US airspace, military and intelligence agencies had been tracking it for nearly a week, watching as it lifted off from its home base near China’s south coast, an earlier sighting than previously known.” https://t.co/izyDUrKRwc
USA freaks-out from 1 weather balloon. China doesn't blink from 10 USA weather balloons. Snowflake Americans looking for trouble &amp; distract from Ukraine/Afghanistan's failures  https://t.co/z220sioLjS
Just announced on CBS news at 5:30PM.  Biden watched when the first balloon launched from China and did nothing while it travelled over all our military bases for more than a week before shooting it down as it was leaving the country off SC coast.
well to be fair, Brandon had to make sure China was getting their money's worth
Rep. James Comer “I think that shooting the balloon down… is very disturbing, Americans are outraged that China flew a spy balloon over the United States … Americans would be outraged to know how much money the Biden family has taken in from China,”
We know it's alot of money
NEW: U.S. tracked China spy balloon from launch on Hainan island along unusual path - and me  https://t.co/ObbkoMZE6c
Biden said, I have talks with China officials all the time.  China likely reminding Biden they have enough on him to see him as the first US President to go to Prison! Biden would have let them spy if it wasn't for the News leaking it. https://t.co/nKTXBIT1xX
Everything this administration does is because of his corruption with China and Ukraine.
Biden 'DID' let them spy!
This is exactly what I was thinking all along!
Traitor, go live with Xi
Very true
He sucks...hes not a leader and NEVER WILL BE
Do you seriously think Biden’s still in charge? I think like the Soviet Dictators of old he’s actually been removed! Who’s running the asylum?
Convict Joe...and repatriate to China... Let the CCP change his shitty depends!
The dumb look on his face tells you everything you need to know.
They only evacuated people in a **1 mile** radius of the Ohio train crash site  The toxic acid rain cloud has a 200 mile radius (that we know of)  Now you know why the media won’t talk about this disaster https://t.co/gAXEaK0wJ8
U.S. recovers electronic sensors from Chinese balloon; Japan says China entered its airspace 3 times https://t.co/0ywBLb39IJ
Spy balloons! China, with their nano, micro technology, satellites that could detect a hair hanging from my nostril, are using a balloon? Sunak 🐍  is ready to shoot them down with typhoon jets, he'd better hurry before he gives them all to Ukraine! Utter böllöx! Distraction!! 🤔
Has the US produced the physical evidence from the ones shot down yet?
Totally agree the EU is a bigger threat than China or Russia. My father used to say only your friends can get behind you to stab you in the back.
I was driving down the road and I said oh my God, another spy balloon from China then I realized it was bird shit on my windshield. https://t.co/GMTybzxRbS
Omg this cracked me up
Lmfao
Compared with the health of the American people, for Washington, a weather balloon from China is obviously more important and dangerous.🤔 https://t.co/gT96l4b4AZ
U.S. Officials have stated that they had been tracking the Chinese High-Altitude Surveillance Balloon that was shot down off the Coast of South Carolina since it took off from Hainan Island in Southern China in late January. https://t.co/NPD0qRIc23
...And that's why some of the counter-intelligence details should remain classified. And rightly so. Never let your enemy know what you know about them.
hahahaahahahaha....  China is in every electronic device in US... hahahaahahahahaaha
Here come the twitter foreign policy experts 
Paid for blue  makes you an expert, right?
So they were spying too??
I don’t buy it lol
The ever-changing narrative from the Lieden Regime.
Court Marshall and Impeachments  Begin now
 (wider radar operators)
Fixed it for you  U.S. Officials have stated that they had reassessed “previously ignored tracking data” on the Chinese High-Altitude Surveillance Balloon that was shot down off the Coast of South Carolina since it took off from Hainan Island in Southern China in late January.
That sounds more plausible. It syncs with the report of balloons flying over the US during trump’s tenure. They’ve said they discovered it after the fact.
The specific term is “velocity window.” The balloon’s moved so slow they were filtered out. Their low RCS was filtering g factor as well
Why didn't they say this from the start.  The story keeps changing...true sign of an obvious lie.
so this happens all the time is what this means
 so why did we let it “float” to NC???
But decided to not inform the president until it arrived in Idaho? Weird…
Interesting decision to let it overfly Alaska and the entire width of the CONUS when they could have taken it down way before it came near any sensitive sites or populated areas.
So they deliberately let it collect over the U.S. before shooting it down?
And they let it cross an entire continent for… reasons?
Liftoff to landing. In God We Trust, all others we track.
Okay, so they only decided to shoot it down when the public saw it?
Could be they found a way to feed it selected data to disrupt what information was sent back to China
Bullshit alert
It’s driving me crazy they are being so hush hush about the other 3. Tons of contradiction, don’t know origin or use. Apparently we missed the one (it evaded?) an AIM-9x and they had to fire a second? Can someone tell us what is going on
And they did nothing...  Great job folks.
curious not to have intercepted before?  if the case would not have been made public, the balloon would still be in flight?
China collects the data, U.S buys the data 
From Hainan Island the tradewinds would have carried it westward? Were they aiming for India?
The U.S was gathering intelligence,themselves. That’s why, it was allowed to fly so long. They did not fly closer because they where still being cautious. Also, it was best to gather the information further away, from China.
Are we buying that?
This message is not for us. This message is for Chinese Gov - and the message is: „we officially let others know, that we tracked YOU and have it under control. Furthermore, we know what you are doing.“
So... the spied on were the ones who were spying?
Thanks for being so cavalier about our safety.
pfft bs
But they can’t find the floating cylinders ….
I noticed that one of the two officials, the female, that "showed" for the presser kept saying "weeks."
If that’s the case…. There’s more of a reason for action to have been taken before it toured the USA.
This may help answer some questions.
It seems that our naval assets can detect slow movers. Not sure that info should have been released IMHO.
Ah!  Conveniently said now!
Does that sound right?  Not sure how far up tradewinds extend up to.
Sure. And I knew the winning lottery numbers after they were picked.
Well, well, well. Games are afoot.
This is even worse. We only responded because the public became aware.  Remember all the UAP hype the govt stirred up? Most just forgot about that. Now they will forget about these "shootdown" events. Lol didnt find any wreckage
Didn't they say it went undetected initially? Sounds like another change in story
Their radar system caught it all,  but they didn't actually notice until some normal guy in Montana looked up and asked questions...   Play on words...
So they opened the door and welcomed it in then shot it down only when noticed by Joe Public!?
Lol sure they did heheh
The irony of Americans being angry about being spied on while their country spies on everyone and themselves
No way they didn't know about it, they just chose not to tell anyone
That sounds BS. Hainan is way to far south to wind up in jet stream over Alaska then down to Montana…
Suuuuuurrrre
Sure you were.
And we gave it a free pass across our heartland- smells like bovine feces
That’s not true
Trickle truth
Did they ever consider that that balloon could have descended to 30000' at any time?
did it lay eggs ?
Believe nothing they say.
They lie
They keep changing the narrative..
Well crap. Should I be worried about flying from CA to Hawaii in Sat? Seriously a bit concerned….
And, they kept tracking. And, kept tracking. And, tracked it some more until they tracked it off the coast. Mothertrackers.
We don’t give a damn about that decoy balloon. We trying to clap alien cheeks. Stop stallin us
Weak leadership embolden enemy states
I have to unfollow you now. You are reporting obvious lies. So they purposely let it complete its mission before shooting it down? Yeah fucking right. This account fell off the moment it starting reporting on these flying objects
Bullshit.  No fucking way they let that fly all the way across the country and map out infrastructure and collect HUMINT and SIGINT
Consistent with this:
I expect you can learn much more by observing than by blowing shit up.
Bet no one has got a video of it, this photo here looks so fucking rigged.  Move along nothing to see here 
And…?
I knew it. The US of A and Canada don’t leave even nuisance acts like ballons  to pass by NORAD.
True, and the reason why the recommendation was NOT to take it down was never because it could cause harm to civilians but rather to observe its path and see where exactly it was going having all that in place they decided it was time to pop the balloon to hell.
but due to complete incompetence couldn’t fire on it until it was over the friggin Atlantic Ocean
The idea that you can manoeuvre a giant helium balloon over such distance is just silly. They go where the wind goes.
Good lesson here, sometimes it is better to remain quiet. Now we know they are incapable of national defense.
And they let the fucking thing float across the country.
did the balloon have biological weapons in it? like a new virus? that balloon was expected to be shot down, so i wonder who got dust over w something now...???
More like a weather ballon .... they have high resolution cameras on satellites why would they use a ballon  how dumb can people be to believe this ????
哦，你搞错了，是从中国的西北部地区发出的间谍气球
Joe Biden doesn't nut himself from sniffing kids either GTFO
So then FUCKING TELL US, if your tracking abilities are so good, what were the other UFOs. Stop this bullshit pussyfooting around. WE NEED TRANSPARENCY.
Story keeps changing
Nope wrong one
And yet let it fly...
“Analysts are now examining the possibility that China didn’t intend to penetrate the American heartland with their airborne surveillance device.”   If true, so much for overheated GOP claims this was a calculated humiliation of US.  https://t.co/feF8tKbyuJ
how much does the CCP pay for these analysts for their services?
At least we currently have an administration that would admit if they made an error.
So, they wanted to sneak a peek at Canada or Mexico?
As long as the balloons are from , it doesn’t matter for military purposes or civilian purposes, it serves CCP’s interests.  should not treat it lightly. A global initiative should be formed to detect, monitor and destroy similar objects, collectively by relevant nations.
I don't trust China. Who are the analysts? Their backgrounds?
that is wrong the chinese are always encroaching see their preposterous 9-dash line see their aggressions in the shoals owned by other SE Asian nations
Cough cough bullsh_t cough cough
Come on Booty, even you don't believe that one. Gotta admire your cheek though
You believe that Boot?  That the Chinese that spend billions to steal our intell and buy off American engineers, scientists and politicians didn’t mean to send that spy balloon to the US? Boot your ass kissing allegiance of Xiden and Democrats is making you look ridiculous.
Exclusive: The U.S. tracked the Chinese spy balloon a week before shooting it down off the coast of South Carolina. The Chinese surveillance device may have been diverted on an errant path caused by unusual weather conditions. https://t.co/ESXLKthHhg
Biden is like a child lost in the woods   What a garbage story
forget about the stupid Chinese balloons .. senator John Kennedy just told the American public after is classified meeting .. "LOCK YOUR DOORS Y'ALL!!!"
Puro humo para tapar el acto terrorista que significa la voladura de los gasoductos Nord Stream y de desastre ambiental en Ohio. Ustedes son la reserva moral de occidente, son la peor lacra del planeta.
Show us the proof of that.
People - stop falling for the propaganda pieces. If it happened then we need to see the proof of that. Otherwise, its just Wapo trying to shape a narrative.
Is this a joke?
Anyone can actually just walk across the border but a balloon will get shot down
Biden, the old fart, did not immediately order the shooting down of the CCP spy balloon, but deliberately let it float freely over the United States. It is indeed a brilliant move! It allows more than 300 million Americans to actually experience what the "China Threat Theory" .
The us government is actively defending Chinese spy balloons over us mainland? 10% for the big pays off
Wow.  Very suspicious report.  I don’t buy it.
Shocking hammer damage hell dangerous exiled dictator Biden lied crimes charge over against evils son Hunter lied crimes charge and gangster Brother old James lied crimes charge go to prison end exchange suspended no elections 2024 no president end 
The administrations attempt to make them selves look more competent is making themselves look incompetent.  If any of this was true they wouldn’t of floundered for the last two weeks to explain the first balloon and they would be shooting down every random “object” since
So this administration is now defending China?  Unbelievable.
Bullshit
Well, I guess the Chinese weren't the only ones being watched!
If you don't think that weather and wind forecasts aren't analyzed before a launch, you really are either a special kind of stupid or a paid Chinese Communist Party apologist...
We are weak.
Meaning if the Chinese wanted to be on the up and up with us, they would have contacted Washington immediately. Which they didn't.
1/2 But somewhere along that easterly route, the craft took an unexpected northern turn, according to several U.S. officials, who said that analysts are now examining the possibility that China didnt intend to penetrate the American heartland with their airborne surveillance
It’s about power and control right President Joe WALDO! Not the truth and honest for the sake of integrity and good of the citizenry you serve.
Senile Joe Biden is a failure
US elite politics/MSM: ready, fire, aim. Now how about trying to verify whether Hersh's Nord Stream and Israel ex-PM Bennett's Ukraine war stories are accurate, which were conveniently buried by the balloon hysteria?
With all this pump and dump schemes going around and market manipulation by the so called whales, you can still earn well in the market regardless. It is all possible with the help of crypto experts like Reach out to her!

So much for a “weather balloon “ like China claimed   The U.S. military lifts the Chinese balloon's 'priority sensors' from the ocean floor https://t.co/DaDTRDEP7C
Who thought that it was really a weather balloon?
China claimed it was just a weather balloon
The operative word there is "claimed"
Clearly a weather balloon that can double as a nuclear delivery system
Like I said, the balloon was likely “made” in China but not deployed from China. (This video is 3 years old). #ChineseSpyBalloon #spyballon #UFO #lies https://t.co/9l4BKzsaWW
We don’t know what they are. We don’t know what they look like. We don’t know their origin. But we’re shooting them down immediately. On the other hand, we knew it was a spy balloon, we knew exactly what it looked like, we knew it was from China; but we let it fly across America
They think we’re ignorant!
Mobile phones hold lots of our data memories, personal information, &amp; secrets. We have no idea how much data is gathered from us daily via networks.   Most mobiles are made in #China &amp; we're all worried what a few data gathering #balloons are doing.    #BalloonShotDown
True that
So the Biden administration tracked the Chinese spy balloon all the way from China, allowed it to traverse the entire continental US without shooting it down, and is now shooting down random objects we can't identify...and these are the adults in the room?
So he's damed if he does and damed if he doesn't
That’s what you do when your boss wants to try something out.
$400k+ per missile. There goes our tax dollars
When a mainstream media story doesn't quite make sense - it's best to keep your eyes on the stories they are avoiding talking about.
This tells you all you need to know
A known threat is less threatening than an unknown. You are better than this, Ben.
And using high $$ missiles, over US land to do it  Do planes no longer shoot bullets? 
You dont use missiles to pop a balloon out of the sky, you pepper it with 30mm.  You only use missiles when you want to completely destroy the thing so no evidence can be recovered.
So much for that hot air balloon ride this weekend
The Chinese balloon was at 60,000 feet posing no problem for commercial air traffic. It's signals were jammed so that no data was transmitted from the balloon. The other objects were flying at 20-40,000 feet causing potential problems with commercial air traffic.
you sure they jammed all the signals? ... how many different frequencies does an average intel balloon receive and transmit on ..is it on a burst mode? ..cannot jam a burst mode .. UHF or other frequency ..sure it is not transmitting to a satellite?
This tells you all you need to know
On today's episode of trying to act like a hillbilly, Uncle Brandon shows us how.
Ben stop getting distracted by this baloon nonsense
It would seem this is an impeachable offence.
It also crossed Canada.
Maybe he thought it was pretty
Bingo
Yep... shoot it
What more can you expect from the elderly man pretending to be president!?
You've left out the part about congress' investigation into the FBI . ..
Remember they said the couldn’t shoot it down for fear of what it could hit on the ground.  What changed ?
GO FIGURE!!!!!
Ben knows the perfectly good reason they didn't...  but he also knows that you do not
Surprised you didn’t connect the dots and call it antisemitic like you do with pretty much everything else
Matthew Broderick is an adult now, too.  
Where is the GOP Healthcare plan? Well? Or how about plan to help every American? Immigration reform? Well?
Biden 4 for 4   Trump 0 for 3
They've turned up the sensitivity of the radar and are picking up and scrabbling for stray car lot Gorilla inflatables and bendy arm guys ! Sums up this administration
1. Conservatives criticize biden for not shooting strange object out of the sky immediately. 2. Biden recalibrates radar, begins instantly shooting strange objects out of the sky. 3. Conservatives criticize biden for shooting strange objects out of the sky
What did the Trump administration do, besides hide it from you and me?
And “this” happened all the time under trump without his realizing it even though we can’t even define what “this” is.
The other things they shot down were small and wouldn’t cause major damage when they came down. Would you have been cool with them dropping something the size of 3 school buses on your home?
Suddenly there are things in sky. After the biggest ecological disasters in America history. No state of emergency was declared. So FEMA and Red Cross aren’t there to help victims.smells like Coverup.
It's all a cover up for what's happening in Ohio. They want you to talk about balloons and China opposed to the likening of a Chernobyl disaster.
The important thing is, whatever the Biden admin does, Ben will whine and cry about it.
Do your parents ever wonder if all that money they spent sending you to Harvard was a bit of a waste when they see you tweeting the identical talking points as the world record holder in GED fails?
So you are saying that they had control of the situation the whole time? Blocked it from being able to transmit and instead used it to gather info of them? OK
Well, they're OLDER than anyone else in the room, anyway.  Really old.  Like, mummified.
What goes on in there minds…?
Yes. Thank you for asking.
Cowards
Yes…..and now we are going to have a air defense test with Canada today…..
They are trying to cover up the fact that they let the first balloon go all the way over the US.
"F-22s shoot down small 'piglet-shaped' object over the 100 Acre Wood. Christopher Robin could not be reached for comment at press time."
You forgot the part where they missed lol.
Obviously the worst thing they can do is their chosen method of action.
Without photo evidence on the others…yet we shoot down a drone over Syria and have great photos of the drone being hit…seems suspicious. 
No one is safe.
Does everyone in this US feel safe?
Pretty damn frightening, isn’t it
Don’t be fooled. They know exactly what they are.
Self proclaimed adults. (We’ll be the judge of that.)
Has war been declared on the US?  if so, isn’t our government obligated to tell us?
So Ben spends all his time tweeting about his impotence. He had 5M followers but hardly gets a faction of this in his views. His power waning he continues in a desperate hope that he can create enough controversy to be relevant for a few brief moments again.  And he is an adult?
Still better than Trump.
Once China realizes we won't shoot down the balloons if they paint rainbows on them we're screwed.
So now you're an intelligence and counterintelligence expert? What credentials do you have to validate your credibility about statements and criticism of our national security?
I remember doing the same thing with Duck Hunt when I was 9.
Thus identifying a way to overwhelm US defenses.  Launch thousands of balloons forcing the US to expend it's stock of air-to-air missiles.
Well, you can’t be the adult with that voice, Ben. But anyway, what exactly was the danger if they knew where it was the whole time and could gather intel on it?
I found who Biden hired to handle the UFO sightings after the Chinese Spy Balloon debacle.
Tucker Carlson;  "Imagine this happened in Washington DC. If this had affected the rich or the favored poor, it would be the lede of every news channel in the world. But it happened to the poor town of East Palestine, whose people are forgotten."
It is a dreadful reality to suspect that every official action taken by your elected leader is a deliberate attempt to undermine the strength and security of your nation. Somehow, Democrats, their allies in US Intel, and media convinced some this reality was real under Trump. …
Follow the money.
Ben there's a chinese spy balloon in my butt can you get it
They shot the other 2 down because it was at a height that could pose threat to passenger planes. Seems reasonable.
How is that not an act of treason by our president?
No, But they do have the keys....
If this is what adults being in charge looks like, I’d like to nominate my 2 year old’s entire daycare class to run the whole of the US Government.
He should have done like the last administration,  nothing?
It is rather disturbing!
The adults left over 2 years ago. It's Romper Room time...
Not important
Yes.  Next question.
Makes me sleep very well at night NOT!!
That is correct Ben the one object they said was a helium balloon somebody had good eyesight.
According to sources in the usaf the balloon was intercepted at the border with 2 u2’s flying above it one to jam the other to intercept so we could see what they were looking for an once completed shot it down showing we don’t need heat signature to hit the target.
No-see-ums are so damn annoying.
Ben Shapiro try not to be bad faith challenge (IMPOSSIBLE!!!!)
At this point, we need to ask whether Joe Biden got the "Big Guy" 10 percent cut for accomodating the CCP
Soylen' Pants (The Dystopian Future is Now)
Hardly adult.
I can not help but wonder, how many  have travelled through the country in the past 40 years...did we miss them on purpose?
All while there’s a train on fire spewing chemicals onto a town in Ohio that we hear nothing about.
Can you honestly say you’re surprised at this point?
Vectored. Vectored. Vectored!
Treason
Ben whining and complaining like usual. What a beta
The first balloon was significantly larger Ben. I know that’s difficult for you to notice since you’re lower to the ground.
Well Ben at least there's hope because we still have people like yourself. It gives people like me hope that we're not crazy
Agreed.  I'd much prefer a President that rage tweets at 3AM.
i know! the chinese should bring us trains instead, or healthcare, or a planned economy, or housing…instead we got a weather balloon and fireworks.
Yes Ben that is exactly what happened, no twisting by you what so ever
I mean, i think they're lying. Why did the Pentagon say Biden ordered it to be shot down immediately, but it posed to much civilian risk from falling debris. None of this makes sense. The 3 ufos seem fake.
Translation: I know nothing and am an angry elf.
Damned if you do… damned if you don’t…
You should make a subpar movie about it, starring Kevin Sorbo.  Isn't that what you're qualified for?
Now Benny somehow needs to talk to someone with the proper credentials to tell him on the DL of what value the US might or will get from the recovery or parts from the Chinese balloon.
“Every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.” - George Orwell, 1984
Who has said we tracked balloons all the way from China? That would be some truly impressive surveillance.
You're  complaining he did too much and also too little. Which one is it Ben? What would make you happy???
You left out the part where they jammed the balloon and China received no info.
There are no adults, we all winging it… sorry blowing a balloon and hoping… haha
Thank you 
What can 1 person do about all this. Ben I need guidance and direction you give me a direction and I'll do it.  I'm not afraid I'm willing to risk my life.
Just go away Ben…, your shine time has passed.
just FYI, it may generate clicks, but this balloon issue isn't changing one single vote. barking up the wrong tree to make impact.
Look in the mirror, you wont see one
That’s what they pay him for
Don't are jets have camera that see what they are shooting down?????
NORAD is on the case....
They keep changing the story so most likely they never detected it.
it does feel like we either have a jr. high student council running this or the three stooges...can't decide which.
Did you read Crenshaw's thread?
They’re all spy balloons.  They studied the first one.  Now they’re taking them out.
Are you talking about 9/11 between the lines?
Have you ever been positive and happy Ben? Or are you frustrated and miserable all the time?
Did you eat paint chips as a kid?
They didn't track anything. It was spotted by civilians and then they noticed. Once they knew the signature to look for they can now see previous incursions.   All that money we spent on defense and it was defeated by balloons.
I'm beginning to wonder if all of this is just a distraction to deviate attention from the Biden crime family!
Take a seat little fella
So you complain that they didn't do the thing you wanted and now that they're doing a thing you're mad.
Exactly
At least they didn’t cover it up
ben shapiro, I remember I used to play mine craft since I was 9. I'm 12 now. My friend Renee and I played all day and all through the summer. In fourth we grew apart. We always talked on the phone. In fifth I met Juliana. And my friend Renee, Juliana, and my friend who I also use
 So True.....
For Biden is heart broken, a large balloon like that. You don't get to see it everyday. Has to pop that balloon, when is it out of sight.
Says the guy with the stature of a little kid.
Be afraid Santa.  Be afraid.
This is like drinking and shooting beer cans with your buds but with larger weapons
It's not a spy balloon if you are their colony.
If they shot the balloons down over land, there wouldn't be anything left to salvage and study.
Yeah! Let’s all be angry!
So The Trump administration is saying. What Balloons? We didn’t see any balloons
Yes as was reported, the first balloon was above where planes fly while these other ones are in the danger zone. They have given an exploration wether you like it or not.
The Chinese have sent many balloons here, even during the Trump admin.  No reason to shoot them down unless they become a threat.  We were surprised that the balloon moved through the continental US this time around, which didn't happen before.  And yes, these are the adults.
If they tracking all from China, why did they shoot down when it cross ocean in our air space?
But were they able to shoot them down? Where’s the wreckage?
They are using up our "stock pile" of $400,000 missiles.
Yes they are
Shooting down random balloons now. This crap isn’t funny
Trump did nothing
Talking heads by the numbers. 1. Outrage at not shooting down the Balloon sooner. 2. Outrage at shooting things down early.  Offering obstacles without solutions is called whining where I’m from.
Hot takes for the sake of hot takes (and making a career of it), sacrificing any idea of reasonable decision making. This is why you will always stay rich in the peanut gallery. Well done!
You shoot the balloon too slow and I’ll criticize you; you shoot the balloon too fast and I’ll criticize. Seems like we have a Goldilocks problem here.
Ben's second biggest fear... adults in the room
My grandkids one day will think we lived through some of the most ridiculous times on earths history
Well a friend told be that use to listen to Up,Up and Away in my beautiful balloon in the Oval Office
I don't even think they shoot any of them 3 the China one yes cause it was live why wasn't the other 3?
Quite sure you would have all the answers, right? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Would the administration have said anything if a civilian had not seen it and reported it to the media? If the balloon was tracked from liftoff, where did the last 3 originate and when?
Why haven’t you mentioned Ohio?
Oh ye of little faith. There is a huge difference. China paid handsomely for the trip and whoever is tossing up the other flying objects are obviously not kicking their 10% to the #BigGuy
Because they’re lying to us
One of the Columbia astronauts lost his grip on a screwdriver once. It's still in orbit. NORAD knows where it is. If they can track a screwdriver, they have no problem tracking a balloon with a huge payload. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.
So maybe now is not the best time to go up in a hot air balloon ride.
Have you ever had a cell phone with no bars? What do you do?  Allowing the known Chinese balloon to continue accross the country and calibrate test the detection systems sensitivity.  Create a digital footprint for identifying future Chinese balloon characteristics?
His doctor just said he's fit for work too.
I’m glad your out here making it plane as day that ivy league really doesn’t mean anything other than laundering wealth as merit.
Well I think it's  obvious that this is not just a coincidence... They've wanted to make a statement that backfired....
Distractions from all the derailing trains and food places going up in flames
When I was about eight years old, I was taught, in uncertain terms that you should always know exactly what you’re shooting at, and what’s behind it without a shadow of a doubt. Maybe bumbling Joe needs to go to Hunter safety.
We can identify the lies instead
They disabled the balloons ability to transmit data, so no harm done. In fact we learned a lot. Another fine job done by the Biden administration.
Same tactics that catch drug dealers and scam artists.
Ben, sorry, but I can’t listen to anything you have to say anymore.
Exactly....clown show happening right before us.
Insurrection time
It doesn't matter what he does, you'll complain about it.
We need investigations into the lack of investigations on investigating this serious issue
If the Chinese want to let us spy on their spy balloon , why pass on the opportunity?
And the result? We got their intel transmissions, we jammed the communications, and we’re salvaging the hardware. We get intel, they get nothing.
Yes Ben, im pissed because I am running out of ballooms..
they had trouble releasing the Kraken
Beung old and geriatric does not make someone an adult
Don't worry no one will mistake you for an adult in the room
1. He didn’t “let it traverse the entire continental us” it was shot down over Utah 2. Wait, now you’re saying you’re MAD at him shooting it down because he’s recklessly taking down the UFOS? I should have know your position is “whatever he does is bad”.
Says the little boy whose testicles have yet to descend
Sure, but no one ever said that these aren't the adults with mental health issues and serious substance abuse disorders.
Grow up and get your facts straight. The military had it covered. Let the big boys do thier  jobs
This from a person who gets his political ideas from Tucker Carlson.
Well, D.C. adults are different from the rest of the country adults
Oh no china is gonna find out how many meth labs we have in myrtle beach  what are we gonna do Benny!?
No one would make the mistake of calling you an adult in any room
Have you ever tweeted about anything that’s actually important or accurate or not hypocritical?
Their not shooting anything down their lying
GOD have mercy on us all
Very scary
Is anything top secret in today’s world?
And the buck stops here!  Right!
And some how its all Trump's Fault...
Makes you feel safe huh.
Not sure how you feel about your family but I don't want any unknown objects floating over my home. It's a safety issue.
Unfortunately, yes
This is probably an order from Japan's master the US, asking Japan to fearmonger about balloons. Even China is asking Japan to calm down and stop following everything the US does. This makes it easier for US to do false flag attacks https://t.co/tuQskJwxBS
Japan Govt will reduce restrictions for shooting down foreign aircraft that enters airspace. Typical strategy  1. Japan announces that 3 random balloons in 2019,2020,2021 are probably Chinese without proof 2. Japan condemns China 3. Becomes excuse to militarise/be more aggressive

The spy balloon Biden let cross the entire country was tracked right from its launch in the South China Sea.  Biden did nothing. He was paralyzed when he should have acted.
So now you're expecting Biden to control international air space too?  How ridiculous can you get?  He has no legal authority to do so.  Secondly, it was initially reported the balloon was flying at approximately 100K ft, which is 35K higher than fighter jets can climb.
Did any of his handlers tell him about it?
Or perhaps he chose inaction because he is compromised.
Question is, how many of these flew over our nation prior to this one which just happened to be spotted by a civiian.
Paralyzed by money?
How has Biden not been impeached????
Can you please impeach him now
He's not paralyzed. He's owned by China
Said is Notorious for doing nothing, other than cut n paste from the GOP handbook.    Traitor.
He's been paid to allow it.  IMPEACH BIDEN NOW!
You tweet a lot. Nothing else to do?
He owes China to much money, payback 
Doing nothing?  Check in with Donald.
FYI the US Gathered so much SIGNAL Intelligence on China because of the balloon
And what are any of you doing about it! The people feel we are in grave danger! Make a move already damnit !
It said the government tracked. Not sure it went up the chain of command.
Let's impeach him
China told him let go .
Impeach the clown he’s a liability
Nonsense. He wasn't involved in the decision which was made by the traitors who run the country
Are they retrieving the other objects that were shot down?
Biden  Xi.   BIDEN Hates US.
As much as I would hope we did a good job of tracking the balloon, I have serious reservations about anything coming from this administration as being truthful.
Biden is a clear and present danger to USA. He needs to be impeached.
Trump did nothing THREE TIMES when the balloon was over our skies I guess you conveniently left that part out
It’s unacceptable!
Was it biden or milley who was paralyzed???
You really shouldn’t let a low level staff person write this. Try education! Get facts.
He followed the advice of his Generals 
Get a life and do something constructive.
You do nothing but lie and cry. No one cares
I'm sorry Mr. Issa - but would you care to release how you know it was tracked from its launch? Quit playing politics and let's learn from the situation. And it seems that this is not a new thing.
FO. You tried to overturn an election.
What petty human beings you Republicans be!! Be greater! In Jesus name! Amen! Blessings! :)
No one cares what you think.
MAGA GOP can no longer be taken seriously on national security. First they said the surveillance balloon might be carrying bio-weapons and super covid strains, then they bragged about how China never sent surveillance balloons under Trump only to learn happened at least 3 times.
The problem is I do not believe what you are trying to make me believe.
Jo works for China
Formally known as Sleepy Joe now referred to the BIG GUY.
He was probably sleeping and they didn't want to wake him up.
Don’t you have a business to burn for insurance money Grand Theft Auto?
car thief
Chinese payola has a way of doing that to Biden.
Balloon blocked from being able to gather &amp; transmit data. This has been clear from day1. You lying is disgraceful. People actually believe you &amp; there is/was no danger. One day you’re going to have to relay a serious issue &amp; people will die b/c they’ll think it’s just more hate.
Darrell is worried about the lawsuit from Hunter Biden because of all his lies so now he’s going to make up lies about the balloon.  The only one paralyzed here is Issa. He can’t seem to do anything good for this country.
Thanks for the update!
I believe Biden was paid for letting the spy balloon cross America by China !
It seems like Biden gave them everything they wanted, then he shot it down.
This is distraction from pipeline &amp; Ohio
Nap time… respect your Elders
He’s hardly even alive at this point
Dude you have no credibility on anything except trying to overthrow democracy. And you even failed at that.
Serious question:  When did DOD inform POTUS?  Or was General Milley handling it with his CCP counterparts?
Trump's fault.
Fking traitor !!
FIGHT!!! You have got to FIGHT!!!
He acted when it was safe for the citizens of America
Would you please email your constituents your speech or any talk you gave at the WEF Davos forum?  I'm on your email list.  Thank you!
Trump couldnt even find them when he was in office.
China tells him what to do!
#IMPEACHBIDENNOW
Biden is a great thief and masterful coward and liar!
Talk to the pentagon tough guy.   Oh wait, maybe they don’t take tour calls because you’re a fraud?
It took him a week to come up with "it was the radar fault"
Paralyzed?  No he intentionally allowed that balloon to float across the U.S.  Why did he allow it?  We all know why.
Go back to Hunter’s laptop. This line of bs ain’t going anywhere
No one told him which means he’s nothing more than President in name only. As much as I dislike Joe Biden what his family has done to him is nothing less than abuse.
paralyzed' by his 10% for the Big Guy. #ChinaWhiteHouse
Nobody believes Darrell Issa, a pro-Putin, anti-American member of Congress. Remember he is close to Trump (said he will always stand by Trump) and likely advised Trump to praise Xi and send love letters to Kim Jong-Un.
He was probably getting an infusion, showering, meeting with election riggers, looking at his Corvette, rehearsing lies, diaper shopping, falling off his bike, falling upstairs, looking for the Easter Bunny, reviewing resumes of non-binary alphabet soup libs
Impeachment is the only answer here. He's destroying America. What are we waiting on???
Some commander in chief he is.  Smmmh.
They tracked it all the way from China !!!  Jeeze!
He  wasn’t  paralyzed.  He  made  a  decision  the  Blinken visit  to  China  was  more  important.
Laughable you’d even think such a thing…, it’s all intentional. They are destroying our camp tree and you folks just don’t have the backbone to stand up to them
Who ordered the stand down and recall of the F22s launched out of JBER? We have OPLANs in place for this. Who overrode them? Ultimately it falls on I would like to see how that unfolded. Since my Reps don’t give a fuck about it maybe you could?
The DOD allowed the balloon calamity to happen to force Joe Biden to announce that he is not running for president in 2024, so they can tell Democrats who they have to support. The Democrat Party is a very obedient ideology.
I have to wonder is is dependent on #China for his car alarm company?  Is that why he is helping #Xi?  #GOP
Sorry  to  tell  you  this  Congressman  Joe  is  Non  Compis  Mentis.
Biden shoots down these potential threats, whereas Trump chose to ignore them! Trump is owned by the Russians, the Chinese and the Saudis. Everyone knows that.
Lots of misinformation. For Issa, it is politics first and country last.  Do you good people down in the trenches really want to believe this. Think, please, I know you are smarter than Issa. You created America not him and his cronies.
When Comrade Darrel lips move, the sound of Putin propaganda is heard.
Biden was bought by the Chinese a long time ago.
China even emits it was their balloon what a slap in the face to the president send back our balloon yeah he's to send it back with sanctions and a military warning
paralyzed, I think you mean controlled by
Joe Biden is owned by China. ..how much kick back pay for play money did China Joe receive for allowing this spy balloon across the USA?
Paralyzed like HRC with Benghazi 
Go sleep barely your sugar is high
Biden was paralyzed by Soros and Ob666ma’s order.
BIDEN HATES US! He’s probably behind the China Balloon spying
This is why republicans are now dangerous to lead our country. They will take any national security or foreign policy issue and twist it for political points. They will treat a surveillance balloon akin to nuclear strike. And spread hysterical fear of made up bio-weapon balloons
When Trump was president they didn't even figure out that China was flying these same spy balloons over the US. But you want to condemn Biden admin for tracking one and destroying and recovering it safely? We need to investigate why Trump let this happen.
What a disaster.  BIDEN = EPIC FAILURE
Biden’s just following orders from Xi. That shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.
Baseless accusation. You don't know what our military &amp; IC was doing. Stop misleading your sheeples.
So much ignorance packed into this tweet
He wasn't paralyzed... he was in on it!!  LET'S GO BRANDON!! #FuckJoeBiden
He acted. The CCP has been paying off the Biden family for years. It was payback time for the enemies of America and Biden was happy to oblige.
You really know all the facts that went into that decision?
...he did as he was told
Compromised. #JoeBiden is Compromised.  #TRUMP2024ToSaveAmerica
The trump administration didn’t even know they were balloons flying over yet here you are clutching your pearls ever so tightly #GOPClownShowContinues
Biden has ALWAYS BEEN paralyzed when he should have acted. That's his core value.
He wasn’t paralyzed, he obeyed them.  He’s their puppet and is comprised, he should be removed from office.
Rep. Issa,  25th Amendment!!!  The Balloon Buffoon is unfit for office!  The biggest security threat to the U.S. is Joe Biden! . . . PRS (Paul Revere Society).
Biden as usual your shellshocked asleep at the switch so called president. Aahhaha
He shot the balloon down. Trump let the balloons fly. Your hypocrisy is showing.
Perhaps you should try to be a considerate Republican instead of being a hypocrite and talking badly about others who don’t share your views. I cannot understand why our politicians have to be so ugly when responding on FB I know Trump made it okay but I’m saying it needs to stop
He shot it down! and you're an idiot.
Biden is controlled by China, that is obvious, everything he advocates helps China and hurts Americans. But if he thinks that China will hide the corruption and treasonous acts by the Biden family in order to pocket millions he is as delusional as he appears.
January 6th 2021  Fuck you.
Republicans sacrifice us to NRA , abandon us in a pandemic , betray us on J6 , and doom us on climate action . !GenXYZ can not be moved. 2024!
Biden is mentally paralyzed.  What did you expect?
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (KJV Bible - John 3:16)
Entrepreneurship isn't easy just like protesting when you don't have a clue about what's going on... In case you are seeking an option on how to trade in stocks and Bitcoin, get in touch with tweets, posts and strategies.
And he didn't get in the car
You are an idiot !
Paralyzed? Are you an expert on intelligence gathering now? Your home state of Ohio is a toxic disaster but don't slow down your stupid political jabs to help anyone.
No one cares about the dumb balloon. What about the environmental disaster in Ohio.
Smokey back room deal with xi? Kinda like the one Schumer had with manchin?

U.S. officials first spotted the Chinese spy balloon when it lifted off from Hainan Island in China last month and continued to track it as it flew over Hawaii and Alaska for a full week, before flying over the rest of the country, reports https://t.co/T5T5Zx8bkv https://t.co/iszracOalN
What about Ohio? Are weather balloons really THAT interesting?
Is good know  pentagon keep one eye in safe american people
So this administration did nothing about a spy balloon flying over the country?
And what is your he translation?
So what if they guy in Montana had not seen it.  Four days before his sighting I saw something over GA. I’d it possible I saw one too?
Remember, NORAD stepped up their radar sensitivity in response to the first balloon. The next three tiny ones are very likely those harmless research balloons all over the skies that NORAD usually filters out.  People are never going to believe that now, though.
That makes them negligent in the security of our nation. Court Marshall them.
this was no mistake
That contradicts what Biden and WH had claimed
Joke Administration
The real America. No balloons.
Flew over Guam and Hawaii, Alaska, Montana, and other states with military installations. Just “Carrie’s by the wind”. Out of control? I think not.
The Question of the day is; was y’all lying in the beginning or are y’all lying now?
Did they get all the info they needed on our installations at Pearl Harbor, Wake Island, and Guam?? The Biden Administration is weak, and our Intelligence Agency is lacking more so now than ever before. Joe Biden is a curse to America.
That spy balloon should never have been allowed to pass Aleutians.
So in that amount of time they didnt have a plan to deal with it?  The [lan was not to deal with it.  Weak....weak ....weak.  Lies ....lies.....lies.....  Does Joe Biden know he is President and his 1st Job is to defend the country agains all enemies Foreign and domestic  /  NOPE
They lied from the beginning. They saw it the whole time. The guy in Montana blew thier cover
So why did we let it fly across our entire country before shooting it down.
I have faith that our government knows what they are doing, regardless of who is President. I am sure President Biden was listening to the military and seasoned personnel in making any decisions.I am pretty comfortable that I don’t need to know everything.Secrets can be valuable.
How many versions of the same event have we now heard? Anyone keeping track?
AND????? Oh my God - stop pretending you understand our NATIONAL SECURITY PROTOCOL. OMFG do you NOT know they can gain a ton of info from that damn thing by allowing it to fly? JFC you people are IGNORANT, ARROGANT republicklan boot lickers!
Gonna let Russia have a crack at it next?
....while 1 out of 3 high schools girls contemplate suicide. Biden failed Americans during the pandemic when he overlooked the need for mental health support.  Wait list are still long today.
What say you republicans domdom trump did NOT know there were surveillance balloons because he had to go golf.... yet Biden knows about Hainan island.....hmmmm
https://t.co/Tuagnj4cUg
Yes, we all know but get back to work and do some butt scorching hearings about it!
nobody believe u
Many people should be fired over this. If you ask me, it’s treason.
China has the right to monitor its colony.
Figures. Is anything getting done about Ohio? Did president speak on it?
you watched as lots of little boys were molested but you didn't say a damn word.  you denied it.  What's that say about you?
THE ENTIRE BIDEN PRESIDENCY IS A DISTRACTION.
Sure they did
Now, if we could just find out more about the contamination of East Palestine, Jim. We already know everybody spies on each other. Most of the world has a cell phone (even though I haven't) and we know we are followed through them. When will the townspeople get some real help? 
Kinda like you watching young men get molested at OSU
Our President is a foreign agent.
Biden and so many others in our government have been purchased like commodities. They couldn't interrupt the spy mission. They were under orders from their owners.
They're trying to distract us with "UFOs"
Broken Record, Jim
Thousands of people IN Ohio are worried about their health and he’s worried about balloons 
China's assistant in getting Biden elected is paying dividends for the CCP.
Impeachable. #1 roll of president is to protect US citizens. Letting a spy ballon fly over entire US for a week gathering info of our military sites is impeachable
I know this is hard for you, but try and pay attention. THEY MONITORED IT, SCRAMBLED THE SIGNAL, SHOT IT DOWN SO THEY CAN GET THE WRECKAGE! It’s really not that hard to tell the truth Gym
Groomer
The US is mad that while spying on China, China spied on them.....
So the US watched it take off but didn’t bother trying to call the Chinese until after it did it’s job.
And YOU did NOTHING.  #TrumpForPrison2024
CAUTION! Overall, we rate The Daily Wire Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that align with the conservative right. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the promotion of propaganda and a FAILED FACT CHECKS.
Why isn't Jim Jordan in the 2024 Presidential race?
So we’ve known about ‘many of these over the last several years’ or ‘we just recalibrated to pick these us’…which is it?
This is not getting any answers, the worst President ever!  We want to know if we are safe, I don’t feel assured.  Well let’s get back to the investigations, this has been a big distraction.  The Ohio train derailment is a huge problem, I do not feel like it has been handled
So they were suppose to do what?
What about this Gym?
do you actually do anything at work during the day? You've been in Congress how many years and how many pieces of legislation have your name on them??
Jim Jordan, you are an absolute disgrace. I just wanna know, how do you get away with not doing one days work?
So?   that means our intel is on top if things.  what did you want them to do shoot it down over a foreign coun try?   Instead they jammed the signals and shot it down safely over our waters.
I personally don't think the US government should disclose all its anti-spy and tracking capabilities to the public and, well, Chinese Intelligence.  Now, if members of the House think otherwise, they should probably not be in the House.
Gym Jordan watched student athletes get sexually abused and said nothing... just stood and watched.
And WHEN are ya'll going to do something about it?? Asking for AMERICANS
Daily Wire 
You believe something reported by The Daily Wire? That's pathetic.
Jim Jordan isn’t honest about his personal behavior, so he changes the subject by asking about everyone else.
"Jim Jordan called me crying, groveling, begging me to go against my brother, begging me, crying for a half-hour," DiSabato said Wednesday. "That’s the kind of cover-up that’s going on there."
More like a weather balloon owned and paid for by the American Government.
It Comes from China  h/t
Meanwhile a quarter million secret police stomp all over the citizens the swore to protect. That’s death sentences.
East Palestine pets and wildlife are dying. Why isn't there anyone out there helping them? Bring in fresh water, send in help to clean their homes of chemicals, free Health Care for them and their pets, DO SOMETHING!
A compromise president it's going to rule into the best interest of the people he compromised by China you working with a traitor president his goals is to take all America's money waitresses stock Payback Social Security and Medicaid apps that make $600 to brake you ..
And gained a lot of intelligence in the process, Gym
You know satellites are on balloons can we get one of you to stop lying to the people please . Say it with jimmy ‘THE EARTH IS FLAT . Cmon jimmy you can do it
So i was not in the room but surely someone jumped up and put some foot in some ass in asking why DOD was well aware of this yet did nothing? Why did they do nothing?
Hey genius, you do realize we cannot shoot anything over another country's airspace right? They had to wait until it came over our own airspace. How the hell have you been in office for 15 years Gymbo. Do you even pay attention to what's going on. What a disgrace you are
How about the J6 Tapes...you seem to be quite the fraud...New House my ass.
Its odd that after getting your asses kicked at the State of The Union address that all republicans can talk about is a balloon but not the debt limit. 
China paid the Biden’s for access
China is exploiting an incompetent White House Administration and their weaponized counterparts.   Democrats - Was that voter fraud worth it?
The first Joe Biden was made aware was when this invasion was over Montana and was already reported by sightseers on the ground!
It’s scary on how many supposed Republicans follow your bs. The same ones who thought January 6th was a good thing
What’s Classified if we are reporting that we don’t know what the other three were, yet again we used missiles for the takedown? Since when do we shoot things down without verifying what they are?
Maybe they wanted to capture it to gain Intel on the technology? If they were able to jam the transmissions,chances are they were able to also input Disinformation! You always seem to make accusations about classified shit no one can dispute w/o breaking laws! Its pathetic!
So you just let the Chinese know how good the US surveillance apparatus is.
Jordan’s loudmouth is a national security threat out of touch but aware of the harm he’s causing
If so then Biden administration has lied to America people once again!  It was only bought up cause a citizen in Montana saw it
GYM Jordan, see any kids lately, you LIAR!!!
Jesus. An even bigger FAKE NEWS source than citing The Examiner. Most other sex offenders know better.
The only thing you have in common with that balloon is being a bag full of useless gas.
I find it funny how no points out that these balloons round or not are made to look like the moon in the sky during daylight hours. China sure knows how to pull fast ones especially when they have the Bidens, Obama's, Clinton's, WEF and the Bush's etc. in their back pockets. 
Pres. Biden will wait until the scientists &amp; engineers figure out what payload of the balloon is/was &amp; what it was for. You would love him to say any little thing an be wrong. You could just lie about what is was doing &amp; be done with it. If don't like the answer, you will lie.
There were 3 balloons while Trump was in office . 0 shot down. Just an attempted coup. An attempt to overthrow the U S government. What have you said about that?
Can americans borrow the missels we paid for so we can secure our skys
You mean the US balloon. Distractions and people still fall for it. Like ufo's  after the stolen election yrs or the fake pandemic to hand out poison to mame and kill Americans. Yet people still fall for everything.
Well he has to pay back that which is owed, do you think that money sent to Hunter was free?
Bengazi Afganistan Crimea Ukraine  The common denominator I'm afraid the United States is next on the list. If I were an adversary, now would be the time to strike. #shitshowjoe has weakened  every facet of our country and it's ability to defend her.
It was the DOD, dumbass. Because Biden let's people who know what they're doing handle this shit. He doesn't post pictures holding a gun that doesn't have the ability 2 shoot 12 fucking miles into the air like a goddamn moron.
We Jordan you know the track of the ballon and China knows where every base is and the  equipment is. Good trade off.
Have you checked out East Palestine IN YOUR HOME STATE. WHAT THE FCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT! U HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE SAFETY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS!
He let China gather intelligence data - intentionally is paramount to TREASON
Biden is legit trying to destroy the United States
That's what BIDEN went to MEXICO to egg if drugs don't come to the USA for free there are senators, deputies, presidents, admirals, MEXICAN AND AMERICAN generals stuck up to the trunk AMLO is the figure at this moment of SALINAS, LARREA, SLIM, DEL VALLE , ETC...

WTF, Daily Wire? Man, Biden is getting all the mileage he can out of this. If the Chinese ate a nail they'd shit a corkscrew. Enjoy the show.
Daily wire.... Gtfo
Let me get this straight….Biden and the incompetents leading the military let an actual Chinese spy balloon fly over multiple secret military areas and across the entire U.S. but mercilessly shoot down actual weather balloons and county fair balloons on sight?
Trump Officials Roll Back OBAMA’s Oil Train Safety Rule The Trump administration on Monday repealed a mandate that would have required trains carrying crude oil to use special brakes with new…
China says "the balloon was an unmanned weather airship that was accidentally blown off course and accuses the U.S. of overreacting in bringing it down with a missile fired from an F-22 fighter jet."  "Weather airship" 😉  U.S. weather airship. https://t.co/BvxVvBRKhC
The USA insists upon falling into #ThucydidesTrap
I disagree. It's not volume, it's not age, it's technology that will prevail.
The F-22 just ventilated the "weather airship" so that it's equipment had plenty of "air holes" before it crashed into the water!
Not how war works.  They are 5 times our size, more fighting age males than we have people.  There is a reason we will only engage offensively until and unless we outnumber the enemy 3 to 1.  It is a simple story tole by the tale of the tape--we lose to China.
Now I know. Whew..
I remember an aircraft flying off the coast ,not even in their waters and they crashed into it with a plane "p3 Orion", and forced it to land ,and then stripped it and gave it back to us in boxes .....like that?
Wow! At least they gave it back I guess lol
That's why it's a little rich, to hear them talking about invading airspace, And how we should have tolerated this, and just accepted it was an accident....... nah,
“Since last year, US high-altitude balloons have flown over Chinese airspace 10+ times without authorization from China. The US needs to reflect on its own behavior &amp; change course rather than attacking others &amp; stoking confrontation"  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin https://t.co/BQnxRXevuu
Thought Joe Biden had been in charge for 2 years? Everything that goes wrong is blamed on President Trump. From train derailment to China balloons in the air! Joe Biden promised us once he became president he would be responsible! https://t.co/aJAogefP4q
MAGA is mad at President Biden for a rail accident that was only possible because of railway rules deregulated under Trump.  You can't make this stuff up.
Thought Joe Biden had been in charge for 2 years? Everything that goes wrong is blamed on President Trump. From train derailment to China balloons in the air! Joe Biden promised us once he became president he would be responsible! https://t.co/lvzFSTXwND
So, the very same Republicans who voted AGAINST the infrastructure bill, are now whining about our infrastructure?
And then he forgot
Unfortunately
Of course the truth comes out…the US tracked the Chinese balloon from its launch on Hainan Island and admits it was blown off course due to weather 🤦🏻‍♂️ of course the damage is done, most of 🇺🇸 now hates China even more and our media is to blame  https://t.co/mVqgaq4wx4
Western media keeps calling it a “spy” balloon without any evidence it’s actually used for spying. It had solar panels, many sensors, communications equipment including antennas but how did they conclude it was used for spying?  Two Bit da Vinci’s guess seems the most plausible:
The spokesperson insists the balloon was a “civilian airship”. But almost three weeks have passed and no Chinese scientific or research entity has come forward and claimed ownership of it. twitter.com/TIME/status/16…
"Our" media??? No, the media in the west belongs to oligarchs that are part of the military industrial complex. Their sole functions are to disseminate government propaganda and create fear and loathing.
 truth Stewart
The more you know.
Also, Fox News is fair.
Yet, I keep getting reminded there's no Sinophobia. I'm very saddened but will continue to be a bridge in US and China relations too. 
Yet they keep calling it a spy balloon. Western media is so dishonest.
I'm not subscribed to that virtual toilet paper so I can't read it.
Cyrus, the Chinese spokespersons are no better. They are now making farcical counter claims.
Washington Post is garbage, but appears credible to American's who prefer their media CIA certified. Some other nonpay site must be reporting this, too.
To summarize the Balloon Hysteria
So no question as to why weather balloons from Hainan are flying across the entirety of the Pacific?   Of course you can't change your narrative right?
Why PRC did not inform US of this rogue balloon? Why they first tried to deny its existence? Why PRC is always constantly lying?
Except that it’s not a weather balloon
Truth? Biden and Co are lying because they either detected it too late or they’re lying to cover up treason. The tell when they lie is that they always attempt to pin their failures on the previous admin.  They did that again. The Biden admin is a kaleidoscope of lies.
Ummm.. it says "may". You rip on the media and yet you yourself post misinformation like a tool.
China is crap
Tracked from launch? Did the balloon file it's flight plan with the US? How did they know it's heading towards US from launch? Did they track the Chinese balloon with one of their own from start?
Our media will take anything and blow it out of proportion to serve their needs...absolute shame
The  same  can  be  said  about  CCP  propaganda  .
Maybe that was the plan
It’s same narrative of China having 1 million deaths per month after lifting lockdowns. Nonsense!
All clear folks, the chinese #spyballoon "MAY have been diverted on an errant path caused by atypical weather conditions   Its assumed actual destination was #Guam - "the possible pearl habour of the 21st century" "to monitor U.S. military installations"
Most people find the whole balloon thing funny, I wouldn't be too worried about it. The only real issue is just Taiwan.
You all realise that this ongoing balloon malarkey is also to divert mass attention away from the US's disgusting deeds, like them blowing up Nordstream 2, also the Ohio chemical trainwreck disaster, &amp; refusal to lift sanctions on Syria, condemning desperate earthquake victims.
so?  even china stated that the balloon is MAINLY for meteorological research, but not completely for that purpose.
hey cyrus, any comment on the wuhan protest that's spreading like a virus?  在线等。。。
And I dare you to fly a balloon, large sized one, in China, and I don’t think I can bail you out. You will be treated as a “spy” for sure. Remember the Michaels?
Don't look up at any balloons in the sky, look at the Ohio sky
So is surveillance china in the first place. How unexpected is that
Is it a spying balloon or not?
Hundreds, thousands of people are helping china with US information.
Taiwanese hate China more lmao
My speculation is these balloons were sent out to track US air carriers, which are believed the biggest threats for PLA's efforts of taking over Taiwan. They were supposed to form a surveillance matrix over Pacific Ocean.
The meal tonight will be great. I like Chinese food too. I keep good company though.
Are you sure China launched a balloon carrying equipment the size of a bus to monito the weather?
Do you hear the drum beats of war? They are getting louder.
oh well
Interesting weather though, only blown off to sensitive area, and Alaska first to "visit". Should check on weather, wind speed and direction map of that day.
Kind of wondering if the East Palestine, OH train derailment made this "balloongate" such a big deal.  Just another "don't look there, look over here" play on the masses
Folks might figure out what that "made in China" label means.
Shouldn't the main point be that China violated the sovereign territory of another country and no matter how naive that makes any of us, the response (shooting it down, sharing the info with 40 other countries), was no different than what China would have done?
Those balloons are manouverable and aren't easily get blown off by weather. They follow the jet streams and can manouver itself by going up or down to catch certain jet stream. For it to just get blown off by weather is pretty unlikely but i won't rule out the possibility.
What the US government needs now is to divert people's attention. After all, what happened in Ohio is so serious
Wow. So good.

It just loses conscience for money. It can point to a deer for money and say: that's a horse
Typical Maoism. My Chinese American friends and colleagues taught me so much about the evil Chinese regime.   They absolutely find it amusing how Americans are suckers to China's brutality.....  I wholeheartedly agree!
How long could these balloon-headed  politicians and MSM manipulate the people when living standard keep declining and poverty rising ?
American ruling elitist cabal may end up cornering themselves into a war with China in which they r in no position to fight for lack of soldiers, weapons n ammunitions. American superior military technology is a myth. The Chinese has precision bombs n they r ahead in hypersonic.
When will the truth about the Criminal Party of China (CPC)’s Coronavirus  research at the Wuhan lab come out?
the medias not control by Biden,but can make more propaganda,so change Biden authorities
I agree Cyrus as I mostly do and why i recommend my European family and friends your Twitter/YouTube feed/videos  That said.The  media took the bait given to them by  politicians. Biden admin bowed to pressure from republicans. Resulting in diplomatic mess and cancel  trip
China’s air space is controlled by military. Nothing leaves the ground without the CCP approval or you will be in serious trouble. You know it, Cyrus. This is a MILITARY mission, period.
If it was accident due to weather, that means the balloon’s goals was not used to spy USA or Canada.
And more Asians in the US will be assaulted
What do most social media in the rest of the world say on this?  America's act is childish, artificial stupid, weak, feeling threatened out of nothing, low IQ, etc. I have yet to see any posituve praise outside of America's press.
The same damned media who ostensibly condemning “Asian hates” are also the ones screaming “Chinese spy balloon”, which so far no official statement from the U.S. conclusively confirmed, other vague claims of capabilities of data collection. Like my iPhone? Hypocritical phonies!
It’s ok. Cyrus. Most Chinese including those not based in China hate America.  You’re the exception.  Enough bullying and smearing of China, America!
Of course, most Americans believe whatever fake media outlets, politicians, government want them to believe.
This was posted in 2018 and taken down now
fwiw, not everyone is easily impressed upon. There is a solid chunk of the social media user demographic that trusts foreign media more than domestic, especially after this whole "we're not ruling out aliens" y'all could see a dime ina house in the 60s, come on, "we dunno" bs
What you said makes no difference and neither does the article when the whole point was for spying. It is pathetic and shameful how far you CCP shills will go to distort minds for their oppressive regime.
Certainly a devious way to escalate anti-China propaganda. Sad and dangerous…
GPS STOLEN FROM U.S FAILED DISMALY
也成功的让中国人更加仇恨美国了。
The truth is bad China had Taoists harness the winds, in the best ZhugeLiang style, to purposefully send the balloon over the US
Damage is done ! The usa Public is again brainwashed to hate China and Chinese !!!
You pretend like you care about “peace”  But you’re just a paid shill whitewashing China knowing there are millions of Americans working hard to undone the damage you’re causing each and every day …  I never understand ppl like you how come become so numb to humanity, decency
Let's talk about Nordstream pipelines
It's OK. US thinks itvis killing China but in reality it is killing itself. Its like US is commiting slow motion suicide. It will die a slow death.
The real America. No balloons here.
Is our media to blame? Or is China spying on the entire world while trying to export their empire of technological oppression to countries around the world to blame? They want to create a dystopian nanny state for the entire world with CCTV and police control projected abroad
Damned media still use the word 'spy'.
How is it better that it was originally targeting Hawaii with it naval base? You also have to explain why all the other balloons ended up over the US! Also why the CCP said it was a weather balloon when recovered electronics clearly show it is an eavesdropping device!The CCP lied
For those of you who CANT understand English: we don’t hate mainland kind people, we don’t hate mainland #china, we feel extreme disgusting how dirty the chinese communist party #cpc is. So fk #xijinping and fk #cpc!
. WARNING !  FAKE NEWS:  "most of  now hates China even more"  REALITY:  most of  now hates CCP even more
Only idiots believe in the US government. All to divert attention from reality. Now they see and shoot down UFO rsrsrsrs
Weren't you the dipshit that first said it was impossible for it be a Chinese balloon? You're not exactly giving us faith in your own reporting.  Not only that, just because it was blown off course due to weather, doesn't mean that its purpose has changed.
Is the FIFA World Cup 2026 safe to be held in the USA when gun violence is a daily occurrence?
Perhaps we could shoot some cheap bullets instead of million dollar missiles at these things, since they are just balloons. That would sure make sense and would be easier to find the wreckage. Shooting with a missile makes for a thousand pieces spread out over several acres. WTH
Dear China,  We don't need balloons.  From America with love, The USAF. https://t.co/I4aZVi6Ha4
US Marine General Chesty Puller never underestimated his enemies. The PLA has improved since Korea while the US military is becoming a laughingstock all over the world. Here he compares our Army with the Chinese.
The point here is they're accusing us of flying balloons over China. We simply have no need to do so.
We had no need to kill a half million Iraqi children either, or 20 million innocents since WW2, did we? So, you're not basing your opinion, which is simply what this is, on the US having any morals, honesty, or agency. China who has 300 satellites doesn't need to do so either.
If you want to believe bullshit, then believe bullshit. Just don't try to sell it here, I'm not a buyer.
You're so full you couldn't buy anything.  Best yet, don't tweet drunk, slob
Go blow your mother.
Biden is running scared about China. He will not speak to the American people against China about the Chinese Spy Balloons , just like he would not speak about Covid coming from the Wuhan lab. Wake up! This is not the Democrat party of our ancestors.
Biden and his thugs just keep lying and covering up https://t.co/cFpX7VRvg3
Ahh, sure they did.
Who would win a fist fight?
Saw that. If true they now have some ‘splainin’ to do.
Our own military unleashed this and the United States military is the fallen angels but Micheal is about to release some fury!! Fasten your seatbelt!!
It’s probably a United States balloon launched from Taiwan
Your extra terrestrial theory is no good. Why would aliens come this far to unleash balloons on North America
I'm sick of the they just covered it up story and then it disappears after being told we have the evidence
Ron is ex military.
Yeah? But George Santos is the former heavy weight champion of the world. And he's also Donald Trump
Hmmmm
Duh - and of course - I never believed for one nanosecond that NORAD did not know the thing was in North American airspace
Yeah right! I feel there more to this. I believe China is not the only one is involved with this. I have my own suspicions about our own government.
Hearing CIA assets observed the balloon’s manufacture in China, and tracked its path over the United Stated to record its capabilities.  Joe keeping us safe. Bless you  
Let's talk about the definition of a colony, Mark. Want to?
This is great !  We are using our most advanced fighter, the F-22 and $400,000 missiles in order to shoot down errant Car Lot Balloons.
Daily!!
"Yeah, that's the ticket!"
What are they covering up???
You think ??
You think ???
NORAD knew when the Chinese let go of the string.  That’s what they do. They can and do know every single thing in the air. When it enters into the air, where it comes from, who did it, and where it’s going. They count on ignorance to get away with it all.
Saw those in key west in 2006. So funny !
They have lied to us so much if they do tell the truth no one will Believe them. So sad
Just another distraction from the crime family
big old Lantern from Winnie
Lookit you with the name-calling
What did you pull that out of?
Remember. tRump was in court for raping a 13 year old girl at one time. Priorities honey.. Oh wait.... They're outside with your morals. Right?
Governments will never tell us the truth, and from what we all know this has been going on for years.
Trying at any cost to Deflect attention away from Epstein List, blowing up nord Stream 2  an Impeachable offense
You’re such a pathetic little man.
I think it’s amazing that the minute Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff are kicked off the foreign intel committees… the Chinese have to send a spy balloon.  Did they lose their source of info?
Thugs... Really
that is what they do
I just call them Slugs.
Now do the one where 3 balloons flew over while Trump was in office!
We need a new Continental Army. This is our chance to prove we could march with Washington and his troops.
Ok Comrade.
Sure give away our secrets are you working for putin too
Okay, so, what was the lie?
“The Martians knew Biden was weak and unleashed their balloon probes to prepare for invasion! Subscribe, for free, to the Mark Levin podcast!”
Lying Levin.
But… that’s the answer you wanted. The USA was always aware. You people are just contrarians. You’re not happy either way.
The liar is you
It won’t be long before he sells the nuclear codes to China.
Same old Nazi tactic, huh?
You call members of the thugs? So sad!
Biden who
Austin  &amp; Miley: “failed military leaders to pretend they are qualified to offer advice to Ukraine on how to fight a first world military when their military records show they failed to defeat a bunch of goat herders and tribesmen with no combat air,helicopters &amp;no artillery”
Woke Military
Good job! Shoot it down and recover it after tracking it and jamming its capabilities to collect any important info! 
Those "thugs" are Americans, Levin. You might not agree with them, but this name calling is unwarranted and beneath you.
Thugs…nice dog whistle, Ace.
Who really knows what truth surrounds the Chinese spy ballon?
Typical tweet by Mark. Full of hate, and anger never has anything nice to say I’d hate to live in his head.
TREASON
Joey had to let it get all the info China wanted first.
Entire Administration are experts at being LIARS!
Biden said we need to revisit that planet!
Perfect, so US had eyes on the balloon from the start and able to monitor it, scramble signal, collect data and shoot it down over a body of water so no Americans were injured.  Thank
So we watched it come from China, enter our airspace, and took no action until it nearly exited our legal area of sovereignty? Really? REALLY?
Dude take your negativaty domewhere else.
What is your definition of "thugs"?Who are his "thugs"?
Mark time for people to rise up and March on Washington
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Right wing propaganda. America has spy satellites flying over China all the time. This is a balloon.
Mark, Do you know why the Trump Administration failed to track the three  Chinese Spy balloons between 2017 and 2021, while Trump was President? Seems like dereliction of duty?
Where's the lie?... come on that's the best you can do?
Only u GOP FACISTS CARE about this
LYING LEVIN!   Have you no shame?  Have you no ethic? -- Making money with HATE and LIES!   Appealling to the UN-educated or POORLY-educated!   SAD!
get a life
This kind of statement is unpatriotic and typical Mark Levin !
Why are they 'thugs', Mark?
Mark I like you man,  Please look at history the NWO overthrew  Ukraine and put in a stooge,the Azov battalions were killing Russians inside a Ukraine Putin went to the UN,did nothing so he went in to protect Russian civilians.
Putin didn't want the Western ideas of chopping off children's private areas, Bring Western corruption of the LGBTQ P into Russia.  Sean calls you the great 1 please get the knowledge on this.
What is Biden really doing while this balloon charade goes on??
It's a balloon snowflake. What could it have done.
You have no credibility you caved to Trump he put the fear of God in you after you originally told the truth about him then you went on the cover up so truthfully your opinion carries no weight because nobody knows which side of your mouth it comes from
I think you meant trump and his daughter are thugs
I’ve said this before, there has got to be 2,000 spy satellites orbiting the earth right now. You are worried about a balloon? Plus spying is done in secret, if you see the balloon, it’s not a secret. Therefore it’s just a balloon, not a “spy” balloon.
Of course! We knew it from moment it was in the air, Biden chose to do nothing wonder how much that cost China? $300 maybe less
"Blown off course"? It was a manipulated balloon, with espionage equipment.
imagine 6 more years
Joe is incapable of lying; but he believes everything he’s told.
99 Red Balloons 
So we waited to shoot down after it crossed America and then we also used 400,000 dollar a piece weapons on car lot ballon's 
Now do the other 3 times it came over befor 2020.
Before you said biden was dumb deaf and blind...now you're mad that he was in full control of the situation?
GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM AND POWER CHOSE JOE BIDEN TO BE OUR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA !                 IN GOD WE TRUST !  AMEN !
When they add a Electron Bomb and take out our grid system who will stand for us then?
Please define thugs!
So I guess you're not thanking them for their service anymore?
"Thugs"? Really? Sorry, you must be referring to the MAGA group that participated in the J6 insurrection. And you said that they were "just sightseeing ". Mark, stop being so delusional.
Please share all your inside info since sounds like you have all of it.
In other words, they are intentionally keeping us in the dark to invoke fear and anxiety in the American people, which throws us off balance.  It's phycological warfare.
You and your ilk have lost the right to call ANYONE out for lying. The moral high ground on lies belongs to dems.
Biden has been bought by the Chinese.  The payoff is Bagram AFB among others and now this, a free look at our missile defense structure.  What could go wrong?  How about a lightning hyper speed missile attack on the newly targeted silos followed by an ultimatum?  farfetched? 
Trudeau and Biden have both remained publicly silent about the spy balloon. The public deserves some answers.  Trudeau allowed the balloon to fly through Canadian airspace before it reached the US.  Why?
Who the F cares about the spy balloon!! ya don't think they know everything already? Lets get back to them paying Hunter in the BIG GUY MILLIONS for the info!!The balloon is just a distraction and you fell for it!!!! What happened to Joe's classified docs!!!!  Bet ya China knows!
Sir my question is these so called spy balloons, do we actually know what they are doing? Could China use these balloons too transport and spread more viruses on our country? The Chinese are evil players on the world stage.
Have u heard about this. Ronald Reagan The Great Communicator. Joe Biden  The Best Communicator.
If true there is no way they stopped the CCP red china from transmitting top secret data back to red china. This was a Treasonable offense. Was it these guys idea?
No! That is Trump's M.O. !!
Where you guys during trump's disastrous years, of hate, fear, racism, propaganda,shit talk on Twitter and many more? You call cabinet secretaries of the United States of America Thugs? This is even low for
Thugs? Pot, meet kettle.
Drown in your tears mark. So much fake outrage for political smear campaigns, you can't even have an ideology anymore. You go the other way if it's not "your guy" saying it. Shuddafukup
Tucker said this on February 3.   Time stamp 4:05.

Is this just the next distraction? UFO sightings? Aliens Invasion? Project Blue Beam? Deep State fear porn?  I don’t claim to know what’s going on, but I detect deception/misdirection. Definitely Demonic.
They couldn't  track a herd of Buffalo that ran them over. What a bunch of maroons  if you think this administration will protect you. Think again.
...wondering if this balloon &amp; the other things were parts of the WEF's projection of a worldwide hack/blackout...the Climate Crazies really would love it....
Republicans and the fraudulent 2020 election lie, obstruction and insurrection will go down in history as the demise of your lying political party and Pox News. Can someone say fraudulent news solely for limited intelligence conspiracy theorists.
Because of this...end of story.
Andcthis
When they destroyed the balloon they destroyed the modual/satellite... why didn't they want to know what they were doing?
Joe Biden isn’t the only U S citizen who is owned by the Chinese
Facts
truth is 85% of CONGRESS+ADM+SWAMP all lie to us.  That is the sad norm in today's USA
Levin is a propagandist.  He's not interested in the truth.
Did you wear a balloon with tfg?
Horse !
50 years Joe Biden hasn't told the truth hes a compulsive liar
This just in! The pilot has been found in the wreckage
Impeachable offense to know balloon was a spying vehicle for our largest most powerful enemy and allow it to be guided over our most critical self defense facilities for a week!
When your money comes from China you don't want to act against them right Joe?
Racist zionist Mark the screwball Levin has a big fucking mouth.
Mark, is it not that The Biden Family (Joe, Hunter, Jim etc.) is in BED w/CHINA???
Illegality in healthcare OCCURING across America.
You mean Biden, who shot every Chinese threat out of the sky while moron traitor trump did NOTHING so he could protect his secret Chinese bank account and "Ivanka's" crooked Chinese patents, Mark boy?
Trump and his thugs didn't even know they were flying over our skies...............
Joebama should be tried as Traitor &amp; Thief, the "Manchurian president", looting-fraud in the Crime House! Gangster thug Xi's dim-witted "chairman": the "big guy" who always LIES! Truth-challenged O-Biden, bent on America's demise!
Trump let them fly, Biden shot them down.   Levin’s diaper is full he’s so mad so he’s making more crap up
Did you hate Trumps 3000+ lies?...
If true why did they hot down the others.
Just because you don’t like the truth doesn’t make the truth a lie.
STUPID STUFF, LEVIN.  “Patriots” like you would spill all of our national secrets if doing so could make Democrats look bad.
One thug to another...biden thugs!?! Judy your hair is on fire...don't you wish you knew something...or had power? silly rabbit.
The new symbol for the Democrat party ought to be a CCP spy balloon.  It stands for inflation, is used by China to spy on us, and MOCKS every freedom loving American who would gladly put a bullet in the thing himself if given half a chance...
Thugs ?   Have you been on the wrong pills ?
PinnochiJoe Biden on day 1 killed the Keystone Pipeline and eliminated 10+ jobs. Outside the far left Dems and environmentalists, ask yourself who else gained? It was the railroad companies, who are also huge Dem donors. Is this why the Admin has turned their backs on Palestine?
Awwwwww come on man. Biden has to live up to the deal to get paid
LINO Mark Levin still hasn’t joined Donald J Trump’s Legal Team.  What is the Lawyer In Name Only afraid of?
Fact Checking...  CONCLUSION: The only one lying here is Mark Levin as the article does nothing whatsoever to support is false claim.  Checkmate.  Fact Check Completed.
Today we are having a history lesson.  I am going to list the tactics  that the NAZI party used to be re-elected into office. NAZI TACTIC  01 CREATE FAKE STATES OF EMERGENCY TO GAIN POWER. NAZI TACTIC  02 DIVIDE THE COUNTRY BY RACE, RELIGION, AND CLASS
NAZI TACTIC  20 CREATING RALLIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THAT CROSS THE BOUNDARIES OF CLASS, EDUCATION, REGION, INCOME, RELIGION, AGE AND GENDER. NAZI TACTIC  21 PROMOTES VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS IN ORDER TO CREATE A MILITARY STATE
STFU loser
its what Xiden does best LIE OUT HIS ASS
Says the idiot who still thinks the election was stolen.
 Warren: GOP woke up want to cut social security. Biden: your VP and I wake every morning, we think of you. VP: the pandemic is not over yet! MTG: liar! McCarthy: it is not true Schumer: they want cut Medicare  Americans: don’t lie to us
You're an idiot.
Biden is our Liar in Chief!
And you sit her trolling with your ignorant garbage hoping people are dumb enough to believe all the politicians and all you loud mouth carnival barker opinion shows aren't doing the same thing.  God you are an idiot.
Singapore journalism is getting worse &amp;worse!As far as this China balloon is concerned, Strait Times just copied &amp; pasted info from western media.They didn’t even bother to verify the validity of their sources.A disappointing journalistic outcome!They didn’t even use the alleged!
Four balloons were found in the U.S. and one of them came from #China, but the origin of the other 3 are unknown.  #CaseyFleming, CEO of BlackOps Partners, to find out more about the balloons’ origins.  https://t.co/3J1KJv2oER
It's so unreal.  But let's get people to focus on the Super Bowl and fake balloons "from China".
Why is it ok to call a balloon that came from China a 'Chinese balloon' but it's not ok to call a manmade bioweapon that came from China a 'Chinese' bioweapon? https://t.co/u9jtrKMdvY
China’s blamed but it could also have come from any of Ukraine’s 33 American bio weapon labs or from any of the other 300+ American bio weapon labs around the world for that matter. Pretty good racket. Outlaw bio weapon research and development but continue to make them. Criminal
Media, helped by politicians.
Because rhetoric.
The mental manipulators would say that it's racist-to say  the Chyna Virus... Blah Blah Blah. It was racist to shut the border.
Selina Wang doing investigative journalism finding a “western defense expert” in Singapore (5 hrs flight from China) who claims Chinas messaging lacks credibility  Well I guess this POLITICO article from 2022 is of no significance then  Who lacks credibility ? 😂😂 #CNN #China https://t.co/Mlt57IOggq
I just found out last week that Selina Wang was born in Washington State and not Beijing. No wonder she is such a self-hater. Probably got picked on at school her whole life. She has an identity crisis and hope she gets the help she needs
Selina Wang is a dirty white worshipper. Confirmed on her Instagram. Disgusting woman.
her white wood is probably banging someone else in AmiriKKKa

#BREAKING: President Biden on UFOs: "Nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program, or there were surveillance vehicles from other any other country." https://t.co/E62KlCnMlc
Cool skit lol
Shout out to Aliens! 
TL;DR: it’s not aliens.
Surveillance is every where when you are using cameras from other countries
Where was this at? It doesn’t look like the White House
What wait, I thought we had a space force…
it was me, my bad guys
China was mad because we shot down a balloon that wasn't theirs
100 percent believable
They are not from China. They are from the Universe.
o que diabos é então
Ready…Shoot…Aim…..then verify policy
When I was a kid, I thought headlines about UFOs in the 21st century would be so much more exciting than this. The future turned out to be lame.
They are less dangerous than thunders.Scouting oil fields something from air.
Tropa do Balão Linguiça
So let me get this right. We have no idea what the objects are but there’s nothing to suggest that these objects are Chinese spy balloons? How’s that possible if we don’t know what they are?
Incompetent.
Wait so there’s possibly aliens and this is the government’s response?
Ohio?
what an embarrassing over-reaction.
Lol  So this is how he’s gonna spin his felony with classified documents from when he was a Senator! Have you noticed it worked “false flags”! Law centers won’t forget his felony!
Joe if you're just going to go out and lie to the American people why don't you just have KJP do it for you? She's so much better at it and doesn't look like a total fool when she's finished! Now you on the other hand......
But we have know clue what they are  Is he dumb or a liar? Of course, both
#UFO  For God sakes, China or any country is not behind this. We possibly facing some type of invasion. But from what
Compromise again! Why is Biden administration so desperate to please China
#BREAKING: President Biden on UFOs: "Nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program, or there were surveillance vehicles from other any other country."
BREAKING: Photo of the farm in Chyna where the #ChinaSpyBalloon are grown.   It's believed up to 80,085 Balloons a year are grown here, each costing just $71.75 &amp; that the plan is to bankrupt the USA as Sky Pigeon anti balloon missiles cost over $80,085    from a Canberra #UFO
Yep… Sleepy authorized the downing of a $200 hobby club balloon and it took two $400k missiles. What an ass!  
America is totally discrediting itself.  all the crimes, wars and coups committed, the world will repay you.
So what joe is saying is he used the military and media to crate a wonderful distraction from his failures!!!   Don’t be a whore Forbes…
A military officer reached out to me tonight: “Biden’s speech on the balloons was all lies”
Target practice perhaps, but don't tell anyone so Twitter blows up
Biden Says 'Nothing Suggests' the 'Balloons' Were From China https://t.co/yVwgqZlx5f https://t.co/ycbww7iVPD
Well if it is not Chinese then it is Iranian or from Venezuela, we know Israel is a "special" friend!
One was acknowledged. But the others could be Russian or copycat whizkids or whatever...
Fox News is suggesting the balloons were from China..
Really now...
Except the fact that China was upset they were shot down and demanded the return of their equipment 
First they were Chinese spy balloons. Then they were not unidentified flying objects. Then their purpose was unknown. Then they were cylinders with propellers. Now they are not Chinese. Tomorrow there will be just optical effects product of the multiverse...
Truman’s Show Set Falling Apart; Truman’s how! Take Your Places Take Your Part! Recorded Everywhere Everyday You Are [this] is arT ~ HaH HaH HaH HaH HaH HaH HaH
Now they were Used car Balloons!! China sent a balloon, we now have more balloons &amp; you want us to believe there from used car lot balloons. Anything to deny its China!  https://t.co/NwL3Vifhw5
They will pull anything to distract us from their corruption.
I’m sorry. I’ll stop launching
NY Post is CLICK BAIT!!
They are coming from somewhere!
The truth is coming：According to the Washington Post,the US tracked the Chinese balloon from its launch on Hainan Island and admits it was blown off course due to weather. But the previous reports made more people hate China. The media is to blame! https://t.co/wwrhkrPHxT
The media is lying
U.S. intelligence agencies tracked the Chinese spy balloon from its launch in China and watched as it may have been inadvertently blown into U.S. airspace, a U.S. official confirms to ABC News. https://t.co/fhNr3WLWht
It was maneuverable. It didn’t inadvertently blow into US airspace. Our Gov let it come in. If it weren’t for 1 guy posting a pic of it we would know about it. Stop covering for this administration
*wouldn’t know
So the Chinese were right when they gave their explanation? Are you going to issue an apology?
Why wasn't the truth told in the first place?
Why does China  even have these balloons, that flow over other countries unless its 4 a fact finding mission? All this the balloon got off course is crap.Why was the balloon anywhere near another country. Some1 n Chinas area was manning  these balloons.I don't  buy their xcuse!
"nothing to see her folks"
This is some serious spin
Inadvertently?
may I ask then, bearing that dead obvious piece of new info deep in mind, are the other thousand UFOs also being tracked? Should we just stare in awe or turn on some entertainment media to diverge? Sorry.
ABC政治不正确
Seems like the spin masters at are at it again.
I’ve decided to ring my airline to ask if it’s safe to fly. Given the fact that small cars are floating about at 40000 feet. That Biden didn’t know were there till they turned the radar up! I suggest everyone calls their airline first
Don't care!!!!!....we got poison in our water
Yeah. Right…
I THOUGHT IT WAS CONTROLLABLE ?  THATS WHAT THE MEDIA TOLD EVERYONE ?
This sounds like a big load of bs but hey what else do you expect from these propaganda arms that call themselves "journalists".
Then a bunch of 14 year old til tockers documented it’s 7 day adventure across America…
Hide it for Biden
Inadvertently.. precious lie..
Inadvertently blew in, inadvertently stopped over military sites. Why are we trying to extinguish this story. What does China have that is causing us to backdown. The US has lost its backbone. Civilization states rise and fall, what side of the graph are we on?
Other Intel sources on other media outlets indicate the Chinese Communist balloon could be “ steered” and lingered over US military installations collectively and transmitting data.
Your story sucks and is bs. They didn't start to track it until civilians saw it.
This is a prime example of our crappy govt putting a spin on a story that we all know they were completely clueless on. Only in america.
#enemyofthepeople
news has lost all credibility and anyone who believes what they report is nothing but a tongue chewer.
Embarrassing to call them intelligence agencies by allowing this.
inadvertently blown into U.S  ? ....BS !
Inadvertently. Your news outfit is a sad joke. The Chinese intelligence apparatus does nothing inadvertently.
LIES!!!!!!! PEOPLE WAKE THE UP!!!!  LIEDEN AND COMPANY ARE NOT WORKING FOR YOU!!!
I'm willing to show 10 lucky people on how to earn 0.92 BTC ($15,000)and more daily. No withdrawal fee You don't get  to send funds to anyone Interested please PM
How phucking stupid are your reporters? You call it a spy balloon then say it was ‘inadvertantly blown” into US airspace. Who TF did you think that balloon was intended to spy on? Nomadic Inuits?
Phuck you A BS News. Cover Biden’s Chernobyl event going on in East Palestine.
 you ABC you are fu#king liars first we didn’t know what it was and then we let it float over the US for days. Biden said he knew what it was on Wednesday and decided to shoot it down now you assholes say we were tracking it when it left China FU#K the media enemy of the people
I’m proud to say am among the people benefiting from bitcoin ,I just got Another $31,700 from my bitcoin investment all thanks to
The spy balloon was actually a stray balloon from a car dealership they say. So China is threatening retaliation for shooting down swag from a used car lot? 🤔
It would be so nice if the US administration was at least creative, as in saying things that are even remotely believable.
A $400,000 Missile took it down
Not before another $400K missile missed. $800K balloon.
Stick with cooking  lol
Yeah right....Like car lot balloons have solar panels hanging from them.  
China just isn’t used to 15% off!!!!
They did assemble those vehicles after all
Trust the science bro… no questions allowed
I wonder if the balloons are representative of garage sales from failed govt.
Maybe China owns the used car lot.
Seems legit.  
I'm sticking with the it was a flying gas stove theory.
Because It was made in china! 
A ballon as big as a jet and loaded with high tech equipment? Sure, I believe it!
I dont believe a thing that comes out of Walters mouth.
Seems legit. 
Wait till you hear about the military shooting down a bunch of birthday balloons, lmao.
Yes because car balloons have huge metal antennas and other tech installed in them
I heard it was just a nice old man and a kid
Good grief. Disney could come up with better explanations than they can.
I saw the tag on the car dealership balloon. It says "made in China" 
need lobster , stressed 
row row prices, come on down today! For a rimited time.
We spent 1.5 million dollars worth of missiles to shoot down balloons.
.... They just wanted to speak to us, (about our car warranties)
As I said, it’s alllll nonsense.
Govt figures the UsefulIdiots will believe anything.
Thank you!  They think we're all stupid without any ability to reason.
China's latest balloon
Well lemme tell ya...if you just say yes right now and sign on the dotted line I will toss in some free helium and a Supreme Buffet gift card!
Lot of confusing crap around this chinese spy balloon.  They (admin) seem to be admitting NORAD tracked the spy balloon from China all the way through SC, yet they shot down 2 small commerical balloons because they tuned the radar?
Yea. Just like on Star Trek, Scotty, expand the beam to wide focus and boost power.  Lol. Hilarious.
This is blowing out of proportions, literaly. They have to be honest and let us know whats going on. Aparently there's been "balloons" roaming since 2017...
Parsing biden's weasel words: "Nothing right now suggests they were related to China’s SPY BALLOON program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any OTHER country.” [a] Right. Not balloons. (Duh.🙄) [b] Not from any other country? Okay, then from China! Just not balloons. https://t.co/x71TA800IE
Tracking the balloon for two weeks and doing nothing is not exactly decisive 
If the balloons were from private companies doing research, wouldn't such companies be responsible to report them and bring them down? It's all very weird and distracting from the dire reality brought about by this Regime... FREEDOM!
🇺🇸🇨🇳 The U.S. will not apologize to China for shooting down balloon - Biden  The U.S. president issued a statement on recent incidents involving China:  📍 The U.S. knew the route of the Chinese balloon, allowing it to protect critical facilities from gathering information 1/2 https://t.co/MFLliWGGbh
 The U.S. is monitoring Chinese balloons around the world   The U.S. is not seeking a new cold war with China   Biden will soon have a conversation with Xi Jinping 2/2
Next time...  NATO - Article 5
Poland    down with orcs Sakramenckie wieczysty 
PRC expected US to apologize for removing an object which illegally entered US airspace? And never had a thought cross its mind to do it themselves? Oh, so following that logic, it is going to be perfectly fine if US starts sending stuff to fly over China without asking.
US also monitoring all the Chinese sky lanterns around the world? 
Whaaaaat? Why would the US apologise for shooting down a Chinese SPY balloon over their own sovereign territory. Unreal...
Apologize? Shouldn't US request the reparation from China?
El presidente #Biden, habla sobre  objetos aéreos no identificados. La inteligencia norteamericana sugiere que los objetos del cielo destruidos en #EEUU estén vinculados a empresas privadas o instituciones de investigación. #BalloonShotDown #Balloons #OVNIS #ChinaSpyBalloon
Uh. Ok. Maybe Biden is figuring out that appeasement doesn’t work with dictators  ? I sure hope so
I understand why the Russians have a conflict. They cannot live peacefully because then they themselves have to work, and they are lazy But why China?
if they cared about their balloons they should have kept them at home
In whose sick brain it even came to mind that anyone should even think about apologizing for shooting down unmanned uncontrolled derelict ?
fake tension... boring
This fcking chinese need their bottom hardly kicked !!!
To all the idiots who find this funny. The balloons can be used  to smuggle biological weapons, so don't laugh silly at shooting them because no one knows if they're smuggling viruses. eg anthrax.
Many airlines heading to #China’s #Shijiazhuang Airport, 244 km from #Beijing, diverted to alternates today due to a #Balloon, Chinese media reported. It seems recently there are balloons everywhere in the sky, from #US to China.🎈🎈🎈 https://t.co/haWMkDmZQM
"We don't yet know exactly what these 3 objects were, but nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other countries," Biden says, though he adds they seem to balloons tied to companies or research https://t.co/WwpbWzfGnt
Elon Musk what did you do this time?
Finally a president who speaks clearly in language that makes sense
There goes the solution to climate change 
Inflation is behind these balloons in the sky.
Does this mean we can’t fly Trump baby anymore 
some will think now they're covering up a red flag operation lol
They were clearly false flags set up by republicans like roger stone to control the News cycle for 3 weeks
I saw a tweet on here yesterday by a company called Nu Ag that was claiming the balloons were theirs, being used for crop information.  No idea if it was a hoax or not.
1. After military action taken over American skies that resulted in the U.S. Gov't attacking an unknown or unidentified air- borne vehicle(s), while also being apparently unable to collect the debris of said vehicles, suggests there is an unknown Air Force   operating in the U.S.
The FAA would have been notified about flying objects at those heights by scientists so no I'm definitely not buying that...
Pretty hard to believe they don't even have a clue of what these objects are.
That will be the only Presser of President Biden's that Fox TV will ever cover hehe.
Was the Balloon from the Omaha State Fair?
BALLOONS! BALLOONS!   Meanwhile over Ohio...
Yeah, no. It's NHI. They are just going to slow walk this as much as possible so the world doesn't go ape shit when they are told we are not alone.
It seems that there should be a way to register research balloons with defense department.
But at least they sure that no people were traveling by these balloons?
Wouldn’t one of those companies or researchers have come forward?
Wait, it was just some hobby balloon ...? 
The only thing more American than "- Hey what's that? - I dunno but send an F22 to blast it out of the sky" is if the missiles would be deep fried and covered in oreos. For democracy.
Cartels?
Sooo weve shot down 3objects that were legally up there doing good research. Now we owe those companies money :) business/government&amp;military need better communication?
These 3 last objects sounds like a musky  billionaire’s new toys. You know, the type of toys you buy to own the libs and Fuuuuuuuuuck with the Biden Administration. Gaaaawdd I sound like the right wing nut jobs !
If they're not the Chinese -- then why do the Chinese say they're upset about the popped balloon?
President booked on the press after they were screaming like jackals about #SpyBalloons. Told them to come to his office more civilized 
conspiracy theory
Chinese spy balloon- sure. Fly over the whole country.  Hobby balloons-destroy them immediately. Tough Joe Biden.
Fucking idiot screwed up weather research for at least 4 labs
So given the most complicated issue with nuclear capability is the delivery system.  China now knows to deploy nukes where the U.S. will shoot it down only to be detonated upon impact. Brilliant…
Thought Joe Biden had been in charge for 2 years? Everything that goes wrong is blamed on President Trump. From train derailment to China balloons in the air! Joe Biden promised us once he became president he would be responsible! https://t.co/PCx7dUt19g

Ownership is immediate.
Joe forgot his campaign promises, like he forgot what he had for breakfast this morning.

I think everything happening is still a distraction from the nordstream pipeline and now wikileaks unloading Hillarys emails and the Biden crime family getting money from China and other places. They want you talking about balloons and trains and things burning...
No doubt, but we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Also, Asange's timing is more likely influenced by developments in his own court case.
I'm sure it is but information is information lol gotta take what you can get in this day and age.

It's so we don't discuss the war about the break out...

From china balloon to UFO and now aliens invasion. Deceptive liberals😂😂😂
The evil they have done is scaring them, paranoid !diots.
Sources tell us, that the balloon sent from China had been tracked by radar from the very beginning.  First leaving China, until crossing over Alaska.  The other 3 balloons were believed to have been weather balloons and were a mere distraction.   Seems like aliens are a "no go!" https://t.co/rgKRj0fqba

This UFO is hard to shoot down. Unshootable Fleshy Object I might say
The spy balloon was actually a stray balloon from a car dealership they say. So China is threatening retaliation for shooting down swag from a used car lot? 🤔
It would be so nice if the US administration was at least creative, as in saying things that are even remotely believable.
A $400,000 Missile took it down
Stick with cooking  lol
Yeah right....Like car lot balloons have solar panels hanging from them.  
China just isn’t used to 15% off!!!!
They did assemble those vehicles after all
Trust the science bro… no questions allowed
I wonder if the balloons are representative of garage sales from failed govt.
Lot of confusing crap around this chinese spy balloon.  They (admin) seem to be admitting NORAD tracked the spy balloon from China all the way through SC, yet they shot down 2 small commerical balloons because they tuned the radar?
Yea. Just like on Star Trek, Scotty, expand the beam to wide focus and boost power.  Lol. Hilarious.
This is blowing out of proportions, literaly. They have to be honest and let us know whats going on. Aparently there's been "balloons" roaming since 2017...
Parsing biden's weasel words: "Nothing right now suggests they were related to China’s SPY BALLOON program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any OTHER country.” [a] Right. Not balloons. (Duh.🙄) [b] Not from any other country? Okay, then from China! Just not balloons. https://t.co/x71TA800IE
Tracking the balloon for two weeks and doing nothing is not exactly decisive 
Many airlines heading to #China’s #Shijiazhuang Airport, 244 km from #Beijing, diverted to alternates today due to a #Balloon, Chinese media reported. It seems recently there are balloons everywhere in the sky, from #US to China.🎈🎈🎈 https://t.co/haWMkDmZQM
"We don't yet know exactly what these 3 objects were, but nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other countries," Biden says, though he adds they seem to balloons tied to companies or research https://t.co/WwpbWzfGnt
Elon Musk what did you do this time?
Finally a president who speaks clearly in language that makes sense
There goes the solution to climate change 
Inflation is behind these balloons in the sky.
Does this mean we can’t fly Trump baby anymore 
some will think now they're covering up a red flag operation lol
They were clearly false flags set up by republicans like roger stone to control the News cycle for 3 weeks
I saw a tweet on here yesterday by a company called Nu Ag that was claiming the balloons were theirs, being used for crop information.  No idea if it was a hoax or not.
Thought Joe Biden had been in charge for 2 years? Everything that goes wrong is blamed on President Trump. From train derailment to China balloons in the air! Joe Biden promised us once he became president he would be responsible! https://t.co/PCx7dUt19g
Pete pass the Buck Buttigieg blames President Trump, of course
Ownership is immediate.
Joe forgot his campaign promises, like he forgot what he had for breakfast this morning.
Statement from #China on High Altitude #Balloons and #Objects https://t.co/wllZKFNTdM
I think everything happening is still a distraction from the nordstream pipeline and now wikileaks unloading Hillarys emails and the Biden crime family getting money from China and other places. They want you talking about balloons and trains and things burning...
No doubt, but we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Also, Asange's timing is more likely influenced by developments in his own court case.
I'm sure it is but information is information lol gotta take what you can get in this day and age.
Wonder if they knew this was coming?
It's so we don't discuss the war about the break out...
U.S. Intel Watched Suspected Spy Balloon Take Off From China: https://t.co/ZViDEMHj91
Schiff’s Worldwide Aeros balloons could have an international partner in China as well as the Ukrainian Pasternak. We know this was an Above Top Secret program evidenced by the fact that Biden didn’t know about it. The surveillance occurred during all the COVID years from 2019 to… https://t.co/zbQ3VTxw1W
From china balloon to UFO and now aliens invasion. Deceptive liberals😂😂😂
Sources tell us, that the balloon sent from China had been tracked by radar from the very beginning.  First leaving China, until crossing over Alaska.  The other 3 balloons were believed to have been weather balloons and were a mere distraction.   Seems like aliens are a "no go!" https://t.co/rgKRj0fqba

PATHETIC: Pete Buttigieg Tries To Blame Trump Administration For Ohio Train Disaster
#PotholePete
Didn't believe it then.  Just another Biden lie.
The China Spy Balloon incident, associated public outcry and general lack of competence has the highest levels of our government suffering from emotional and physical incontinence . . . where we go from here, SIMPLY DEPENDS.  🇺🇸MAGA🇺🇸
Lmfao Bloomberg got the guts to ask whether China is using Nord Stream blast &amp; Ohio train derailment to distract public attention from the balloon. Do they have the guts to ask their boss whether they are using a balloon to distract public attention from Nord Stream &amp; Ohio? https://t.co/iTNH42K84O
The Chinese spy balloons which came from China were shot down because they need to be shot down since they don't have any benefit that's why they got shot down. https://t.co/WWVlZZPqNS
Totally brilliant. The operation was successful.
They all had benefits. To China.
She ties to talk like Obama
Miss Kammy world-class word-salad  is at it again
Friggen shot down Chinese balloon after it crossed the entire US. Then for encore Sec Defense shoots down things without knowledge of what they are…lamest show on earth Biden Administration
NEW: Satellite images apparently show a balloon launch facility on China’s Hainan island, identified by American intelligence as the site where China's spy balloon that lingered over the U.S. was launched from. https://t.co/hL96WWQvjv  📷: Planet Labs https://t.co/Rf75NbO8tv
So now they're NOT spy balloons from China. I can't keep up 😂😂😂
Keeping the Distraction going..  Anything but the serious issues...
Channel 9 paedophile shito
Very true. How are you going Nancy ? 
I tell ya, the US put them up there for whatever twisted reason. Now he’s reneging on blaming China because it’s all such a nut job story. #onlyinamerica
I legit can't keep up with the stories lol  Every few hours there's something new now
May as well make them up. I heard that NZ sent a balloon up but it only made it as far as East Auckland. A copper shot it down but soon realised it was a fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital. The further it went the more $ they get. Unfortunately it only raised NZ$3:17
Are you serious? I can't tell 
I should send that to MSN, they’ll add shit to it and run a 3 minute story in it. c’mon, do your thing.
Im not confident his brain is connected to his mouth?
not just china, from asia to africa, the sentiment that u.s govt cannot be trusted is gaining traction
The world is waking up to the truth. The lies that blinded so many are exposed. The warmongering USA system has become the most destructive and negative entity in world history
Latin America above all, tbh.
KAMALA HARRIS: "We made America's position clear about that [Chinese spy] balloon when we shot it down" (after they watched the balloon take off from China and surveil the entire country). https://t.co/ndXbf5YWYD
Why she’s doing okay. What did Pence say about the three balloons that Trump knew about, didn’t shoot down, and told no one.  #GOPHypocrisy
Most unqualified
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA LOL
Thank you. I needed a laugh.
Admitting alot there Kamala
You are making it clear that you and Biden don't want to work to help the American people. Becomes more clear every day.
Well sense China has really not said crap or done crap about us shooting the balloon down at the finish line speaks for itself!
Shooting down a Chinese Spy Balloon after it completes it’s mission is like tackling the Quarterback after the game is over.
Hmmm...
DOD blocked it from being able to collect signals, collected intelligence from it, and shot it down when it was safe. All of the debris has been collected and is being analyzed by the FBI
The has made their stance clear about Russia
ALL THE WAY ACROSS AMERICA!
Is it a weather ballon or dot ballon  make up your mind.
It was rendered useless. It wasn’t surveilling anything as it flew across the US, and not transmitting anything back to China.
A disgusting liar !
Steve Bannon is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Tucker Carlson and deliberately lie to the American people. They knew Trump lost but they continued to go on air and lie about it. Kayleigh was rewarded with a job on Fox Fake News. Disgusting. They put us in danger with their lies!
You mean the balloon that sailed freely across states that was shot down after every data was recorded that one you talking about or the kid's balloon
Kamala is about as clear  as the air over East Palestine.
Old Indian. How?
Doubt it
So given the most complicated issue with nuclear capability is the delivery system.  China now knows to deploy nukes where the U.S. will shoot it down only to be detonated upon impact. Brilliant…
Look at that SHINY object in the sky!
Did you ever wonder what it was like to actually tell the truth?
She needs to lay off the drugs.:
Thanks Captain Obvious
They watched it! Did Biden serve popcorn? Worst administration ever!
Exactly
Question how does #KalmaHarris feel about her boss as being a #chineseagent?
Mitch McConnell is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Jared Kushner is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
As usual with this pathetic administration, you did nothing until it became an embarrassment.
the trump administration missed at least 3, where they not watching the country that is supposed to be our greatest enemy
i wouldn't be surprised that it was &amp; who convinced &amp; to dump &amp;   in light of all the released internal texts between &amp; it makes a lot of sense that they'd hamstring a competitor.
Idiot
BREAKING: the RNC has found out that China has satellites.
#TrumpBlimpWimp Under President Biden, a #ChineseSpyBalloon was detected and shot down. Under Trump, three Chinese Spy Balloons travelled the US without Trump lifting a finger. Maybe they looked too much like a lied that Trump would shoot them down.
Louis DeJoy is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Trump is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
the only thing you made clear with the balloons is our borders are wide open!
as clear as the air and water in East Palestine?
Imagine all the information the three balloons collected while Trumps administration was hush hush, during his short one term. I wonder what happened to missing top secret classified documents PAB took. 15 boxes confiscated
#GOPLiars
#KluelessKamala
This clip will actually be used to show what target actually looks like
Kamala, open mouth, insert foot.
The world is laughing at our goverment
What was message I guess I missed that one lol
The position that the Biden administration will use $400,000 dollar missile's of tax payer money.., to shoot down a balloon.. That's been crystal clear..
Lol did you actually get it?   Or are you just being a joke?
That’s not a Joke, come on man
It wasn't even a spy balloon, even the Pentagon admitted it was just a weather balloon. Spy balloons haven't been a thing since the 50s.
That is one thing for sure this admin. Doesn't do anything quick but DIVIDE a country
Later rather than sooner we shot down a balloon that had crossed the country transmitting all the way.
I always believed in the Department of Defense as the one department that is and will protect this country. Now I am questioning if that is true today.
I shot a balloon, yesterday, at the  county fair ...
So embarrassing and weak for our country
Right. Ridiculous
DO YOUR DAMN JOBS: #ImpeachBidenHarris
But first we needed to call Xi for permission to shoot it down
..IT WAS - “TOO LITTLE/TOO LATE = (?)/..
Needs a dunce cap 
She is a da.
Please stop talking... Quiet when Uplifted.
Harris is an embarrassment
Everyone knows the solution to the balloon issue is to allow three, or more, balloons to traverse the country without blinking an eye.
RNC, you knew Fox News was lying And are not surprised they are PROVEN DISHONEST MEDIA ☆ you're just part of the dishonesty machine, aren't you?
Sure, sure… 
Why isn’t anyone asking why it wasn’t shot down before it flew over the USA like the other 4 objects.
kamala is trash but we already know it wasn’t a “spy” balloon. unless you consider atmospheric pressure and wind speed to be invaluable top secret intelligence.  also i love that you think us watching a balloon take off from china is fine but the reverse is terrifying and illegal
They were directed to wait until the balloon had gathered the info it was sent to get. Thanks, China Joe!
She is so intelligent
…jammed its communication, gleaned intelligence from it, shot it down over the ocean to avoid injury &amp; so they could easily recover the wreckage   Trump didn’t even know spy balloons were spying on us. The good news is there was no intelligence to be found in his admin
Do democrats even talk to each other?
We will not allow a “domain awareness gap!” Right out of Dr. Strangelove.  
Hi my name is Harris. I read off of what others write for me.
Biden likely got millions of dollars in kickbacks from China in exchange for allowing the balloon to survey the US, the military bases and nuclear plants.
MAGA BAD RISING CHINA GOOD

We have white supremacists killing blacks Asian latinos gays and jews and they still not a terrorist groups los Angeles police make arrest, probe hate crimes in shootings of 2 Jewish men

She's a moron
Your a joke and china is laughing at you...
Strange how CORRUPT Republicans are obsessed about balloons bc Biden is POTUS, when they didn't give 1 rat's arse about the balloons flying across the USA while Trump was despot! Was it all those money making trademarks China fast tracked for Ivanka?
People more stupid than she is cheer her on.
Unqualified impeach these idiots
Love madam vice President
Here is my theory on the Balloon from China. https://t.co/KJZAcX3oqK
Biden may have shot down a hobby club's missing balloon. https://t.co/L0nPsk4idw
Read more:
And Trudeau tweet bragged about giving the order to do it.
I thought of that well, but I was talking about shooting them down
According to Tucker, he certainly has! The balloon cost $12. The missile was 400,000 to deploy. 
Exactly why it isn’t true. Our military isn’t stupid, have you seen how much of our tax dollars go to military budget?
The Biden administration is incompetent and liars. The military has to have high resolution imagery of all of the objects. They knew they were shooting down balloons, but were ordered to do so by incompetents that think we are the stupid ones.
I thought there basically was no circus anymore.  
Sounds about right 
Just another day in  
The perfect metaphor for the pandemic. A complete and ludicrously expensive overreaction to a "threat" after China hyped everyone up.
Perhaps he should hire the best and ditch the diversity hire route.
$400,000 kill shot! We got it.
OMG!  We’re so effed
What an embarrassment.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cornpop-Baloonpop-Brainfart…
How much did the flight and rocket cost to down a hobby balloon
oh  no....
These are not the size of a small car!! These would not be viewed as a threat by fighter pilots! They probably would barely view these! What did they really shoot down? Or did they shoot down anything at all?
Same story different decade #roswell #UFOs
MSM do little other than lie, so I’ll assume this is BS.   We’ll never know 
It’s true. They interview the club that the boy was in. He was 11.
WRONG. The object was reported as cylindrical and about the size of a small car. Not a clear little weather balloon.
In Biden’s defense we don’t know what those teenagers were really up to.
Joe’s a balloon
experience open
NEW: Satellite images apparently show a balloon launch facility on China’s Hainan island, identified by American intelligence as the site where China's spy balloon that lingered over the U.S. was launched from. https://t.co/mGQWhqv2UD  📷: Planet Labs https://t.co/5U2E4t6OVb
So . . . uh . . . how did we get these images?
Bulls eyes 
Now That's !!! The America  That I Know 
Walk into the sea do not return
Report on men in women’s prisons 
But they are just left overs from car dealerships...
wow, concerning stuff! say, how'd the US get this image? and can you think of any other countries with similar technology that could maybe leverage it instead of a "spy" balloon?
this is like a fully geared up SWAT team standing around a hash pipe they confiscated
I sure hope nothing bad happens to it in the middle of the night.
Okay?
Like they think we're not going to figure it out?
ELectrical Grid at risk.
American Intelligence 
I heard news of balloons belonging to a company not any country. If so true why hasn't the company spoke up? I believe it is a big cover up to calm our fears of possibly being attacked.
The irony of this post 
They are evil!!!
Home sweet home!
What about that environmental disaster in Ohio. Not much being said about that...
We spy , they spy. Same games.
I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.  I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.
 Sounds like one of those Iraqi mobile chemical labs. Suuuure, we totally believe in American intelligence. 
Turn the fans on DookyJoe, blow it back.....
Funny I don't hear an apology or redaction in this title
Thank goodness for Google maps So can we all agree to be good and stop fear mongering? Asking for a friend and all the frightened children across the world, who shouldn’t be watching scary #ChineseSpyBallon TikTok videos. #balloongate
Next you can report on their newly constructed Clown College. Maybe you guys can apply for a scholarship?
Don't expect Joe Biden to say something bad about China..

. BREAKING NEWS: #Platform LAUNCH
MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS and the rest are ALL owned by the same 6 LEFTIST Corps.  They are a bunch of LYING, worthless, sell-outs in American HISTORY !!  There are HUNDREDS  of such examples exposing this ANTI-AMERICAN treacherous behavior.
TRUMPS DISNEYLAND.
This is the greatest surprise all my life to wake up and receive $16,000 out of $1000 investment after so many tries I finally found a Legit platform for investment. All thanks to Mrs for making this possible.
Does china have access to these insane satellites or do they need to send fucking 1920s balloons? Fuck off, propaganda rag
I'm still living well, all thanks to Marwah for providing a legit paying platform for me andalso delivering a wonderful trade $13,000 received successfully Contact him for more details
lol, you know where it was launched from buy you couldn’t track it because it was moving to slow - lolol. BTW did anyone in “Intelligence” ever say “Hey Guys do think our enemies would ever spy on us with a device disguised as a Weather Balloon?” Nah, never happen.
Balloons can blow in the wind dipshits
Do you believe that Air BalloonS are From CIA USA MADE, NOT CHINA?
Did you know that this distraction is just that, and if people actually did some research they'd find that the US has 1,100+ balloons above USCities..? Ignorance is Bliss, what is the next Distraction after train derailments and disasters? 
She also indicated he's a racist and owned by China. He's good with hobby balloons. Can't take that away from him.
Kamala Harris says Biden is "probably one of the boldest and strongest American presidents we have had"
He’s put China into our White House. He’s their Trojan horse and the Manchurian candidate. It’s a network. This country is in the fight for our life.
From my own understanding of China, I believe that  Dmitry Polyansky (Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN) is perfectly correct when he says that "China has lost all illusions about West":  "We have very similar views on the West. ..." --&gt;&gt;👉
"... Although China has major investment and economic interests there, the illusions that had existed a few years ago to the effect the West can somehow treat China differently and that not everything is so bad have now vanished. ... " --&gt;&gt;
"... The Chinese have realized perfectly well what the West is really up to.  ... "The West, by its actions over the past three or four years, has actually left no illusions that instead of equal cooperation the only thing that it has in mind is harsh and uncivilized... --&gt;&gt;
" ...competition with China, Russia, India, Brazil and other countries. The Chinese are well aware of that. The way I see it, this understanding is maturing in other countries, too." (TASS)  China is VERY tired of uncivilized manners and lies of the West. Other countries as well.
There was massive goodwill capital that the west had around the world in developing nations that they have thrown away since the fall of the USSR.  I have been horrified how Aust has damaged its massive pool of goodwill with China since 2015, this GW was worth 000's of billions
In 2009, Obama forced Australia to change its China policy. Australia’s suicidal actions started already back then, and China really tried to have patience for a long time before being totally fed up and gave up.
I think it is possible that China are giving Aust a second chance with the change of Govt but I don't think China will be as patient this time round. Alt they are being pragmatic &amp; they are using the change of govt for an apparent reset while developing alt supply chains
The moment of the disillusionment for most Chinese people was the arrest of Huawei Princess in 2018 during transit in Vancouver airport. When power and wealth couldn't protect Ms. Meng Wanzhou, everyone else was vulnerable.
It was an eye opener, wasn’t it?
I'm sure they have. Read a tweet yesterday stating Brazil has now decided to support Ukraine &amp; looks to join OECD. Opinion much appreciated.
It breaks my heart that the lands built by great men have been taken over by vampire like beings, and that the modern western man with power has taken the bribe from these vampires to betray the entire world.
Chinese are pretty cautious and they backbite Russia.  They don't care much about Russia but yes provocations from US has made them kinda angry. But If US is clever they can use China to kill Russia's economy .
Personally, I don't believe China have that interest. For China, Russia is a key player for diplomacy with some other important countries. For instance, Ru has calmed down the tensions between India and China. They need to cooperate to obliterate US hegemony and the Petrodollar.
I've seen many shills spout nonsense about China not caring or being wary of Russia. On reddit and over here, they all smell like 3LA thugs.
The first one was probably a balloon. MAYBE it was from China. MAYBE it was lofted by the CCP, or MAYBE by a private company. How can YOU know?  But importantly, all the USG wants is for you to say: CHINESE SPY BALLOONS  It serves them on at least 2 fronts: not-UFOs &amp; future war. https://t.co/y0K04MxqRf
Best way to counter it is by calling attention to it &amp; maybe, depending on your audience, offering up consciousness elevating suggestions. As you have been doing. Honestly, keep on keepin on, man. You're doing brilliantly!
And you keep on putting out this positiveenergy. There's nothing quite like a person who can selflessly hand out kindnesses the way you have here.   Keep up the beautiful work friend 
Just calling it as I see it, brother.  Namaste 
It's so obviously spin, but what has been hard to tell. This is the first I've come across that makes sense. In fact..... immediate sense and like now seem obvious after reading the tweet.  On that note, I do not concent at all.
Do you like balloons uncle sam? I do not like them, Sam-I-am I do not like spies or commie balloons I don't like chow mein or monsoons I would not like them here or there I would not like them anywhere UFO or stray balloon Shoot em down and do it soon.

Strange how CORRUPT Republicans are obsessed about balloons bc Biden is POTUS, when they didn't give 1 rat's arse about the balloons flying across the USA while Trump was despot! Was it all those money making trademarks China fast tracked for Ivanka?
Unqualified impeach these idiots
Love madam vice President
Here is my theory on the Balloon from China. https://t.co/KJZAcX3oqK
NEW: Satellite images apparently show a balloon launch facility on China’s Hainan island, identified by American intelligence as the site where China's spy balloon that lingered over the U.S. was launched from. https://t.co/mGQWhqv2UD  📷: Planet Labs https://t.co/5U2E4t6OVb
So . . . uh . . . how did we get these images?
Bulls eyes 
Now That's !!! The America  That I Know 
Walk into the sea do not return
Report on men in women’s prisons 
But they are just left overs from car dealerships...
wow, concerning stuff! say, how'd the US get this image? and can you think of any other countries with similar technology that could maybe leverage it instead of a "spy" balloon?
this is like a fully geared up SWAT team standing around a hash pipe they confiscated
I sure hope nothing bad happens to it in the middle of the night.
Okay?
Like they think we're not going to figure it out?
ELectrical Grid at risk.
American Intelligence 
I heard news of balloons belonging to a company not any country. If so true why hasn't the company spoke up? I believe it is a big cover up to calm our fears of possibly being attacked.
The irony of this post 
They are evil!!!
Home sweet home!
What about that environmental disaster in Ohio. Not much being said about that...
We spy , they spy. Same games.
I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.  I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.
 Sounds like one of those Iraqi mobile chemical labs. Suuuure, we totally believe in American intelligence. 
Turn the fans on DookyJoe, blow it back.....
An image from an US spy satelite... Time for China to shoot it down like a balloon.
DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!      DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!           DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!                DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!                     DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!      DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!           DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!                DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!                     DRAMA!!! DRAMA!!!
Because they were aware of it from the time China launched it, but then did nothing?
Funny I don't hear an apology or redaction in this title
Thank goodness for Google maps So can we all agree to be good and stop fear mongering? Asking for a friend and all the frightened children across the world, who shouldn’t be watching scary #ChineseSpyBallon TikTok videos. #balloongate
Next you can report on their newly constructed Clown College. Maybe you guys can apply for a scholarship?
Don't expect Joe Biden to say something bad about China..
#spyballoon #ChinaSpyBalloon
. BREAKING NEWS: #Platform LAUNCH
MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS and the rest are ALL owned by the same 6 LEFTIST Corps.  They are a bunch of LYING, worthless, sell-outs in American HISTORY !!  There are HUNDREDS  of such examples exposing this ANTI-AMERICAN treacherous behavior.
TRUMPS DISNEYLAND.
This is the greatest surprise all my life to wake up and receive $16,000 out of $1000 investment after so many tries I finally found a Legit platform for investment. All thanks to Mrs for making this possible.
Does china have access to these insane satellites or do they need to send fucking 1920s balloons? Fuck off, propaganda rag
I'm still living well, all thanks to Marwah for providing a legit paying platform for me andalso delivering a wonderful trade $13,000 received successfully Contact him for more details
lol, you know where it was launched from buy you couldn’t track it because it was moving to slow - lolol. BTW did anyone in “Intelligence” ever say “Hey Guys do think our enemies would ever spy on us with a device disguised as a Weather Balloon?” Nah, never happen.
Balloons can blow in the wind dipshits
Do you believe that Air BalloonS are From CIA USA MADE, NOT CHINA?

She also indicated he's a racist and owned by China. He's good with hobby balloons. Can't take that away from him.
Kamala Harris says Biden is "probably one of the boldest and strongest American presidents we have had"
He’s put China into our White House. He’s their Trojan horse and the Manchurian candidate. It’s a network. This country is in the fight for our life.
From my own understanding of China, I believe that  Dmitry Polyansky (Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN) is perfectly correct when he says that "China has lost all illusions about West":  "We have very similar views on the West. ..." --&gt;&gt;👉
"... Although China has major investment and economic interests there, the illusions that had existed a few years ago to the effect the West can somehow treat China differently and that not everything is so bad have now vanished. ... " --&gt;&gt;
"... The Chinese have realized perfectly well what the West is really up to.  ... "The West, by its actions over the past three or four years, has actually left no illusions that instead of equal cooperation the only thing that it has in mind is harsh and uncivilized... --&gt;&gt;
" ...competition with China, Russia, India, Brazil and other countries. The Chinese are well aware of that. The way I see it, this understanding is maturing in other countries, too." (TASS)  China is VERY tired of uncivilized manners and lies of the West. Other countries as well.
There was massive goodwill capital that the west had around the world in developing nations that they have thrown away since the fall of the USSR.  I have been horrified how Aust has damaged its massive pool of goodwill with China since 2015, this GW was worth 000's of billions
In 2009, Obama forced Australia to change its China policy. Australia’s suicidal actions started already back then, and China really tried to have patience for a long time before being totally fed up and gave up.
I think it is possible that China are giving Aust a second chance with the change of Govt but I don't think China will be as patient this time round. Alt they are being pragmatic &amp; they are using the change of govt for an apparent reset while developing alt supply chains
The moment of the disillusionment for most Chinese people was the arrest of Huawei Princess in 2018 during transit in Vancouver airport. When power and wealth couldn't protect Ms. Meng Wanzhou, everyone else was vulnerable.
It was an eye opener, wasn’t it?
I'm sure they have. Read a tweet yesterday stating Brazil has now decided to support Ukraine &amp; looks to join OECD. Opinion much appreciated.
It breaks my heart that the lands built by great men have been taken over by vampire like beings, and that the modern western man with power has taken the bribe from these vampires to betray the entire world.
Chinese are pretty cautious and they backbite Russia.  They don't care much about Russia but yes provocations from US has made them kinda angry. But If US is clever they can use China to kill Russia's economy .
Personally, I don't believe China have that interest. For China, Russia is a key player for diplomacy with some other important countries. For instance, Ru has calmed down the tensions between India and China. They need to cooperate to obliterate US hegemony and the Petrodollar.
I've seen many shills spout nonsense about China not caring or being wary of Russia. On reddit and over here, they all smell like 3LA thugs.
When a powerful country counters a threat from an unfazed China spy balloon by showing our might by shooting down three wondering innocent weather balloons navigating above historic trails, waterways and roads in the United States. https://t.co/iaQBhbILCC
Doesn’t feel so powerful anymore
A sad state.
Part of their agenda I suppose …but they can never take our pride completely
Agreed, our best has not yet surfaced.
The hour is late and  we don’t seal our fate
Literally became the laughingstock of the world.  All our former military strength has been weakened. But damn, we are diverse and inclusive.  So sick of this shit.
After the #Pentagon sources confirmed it was a #Spyballoon from #China and decided against shooting it down for safety reasons, with immediate escalations, the Chinese Daily said the spy balloon claims were a lie  https://t.co/AutPPx3dLC
Joe Biden has admitted he doesn't know what the three flying objects were that the US Military shot down.  But he's now confident they weren't connected to China. #9News https://t.co/nnzPyu8jme
Check Hunters laptop. All the information you need is there
Maybe ask #U2
Even if he knew he would have forgotten!
I wonder how much China paid him to say that
No surprise there - Joe Biden seems to be clueless about most things.  #9news
Joe Biden doesn’t know anything. Except he knows for sure they were definitely Chinese balloons and he’s too scared to admit it
Which Joe is speaking
I'm sorry but Joe Biden doesn't know what day it is. Bless.
Sure eggs are $8 and we buy oil from Iran &amp; Venezuela and the air &amp; water in #EastPalestineOhio are toxic and china is sending spy balloons and inflation is 7% and Mexican cartels traffic fentanyl across the open border... but at least the cabinet is a rainbow!
Color and gender is priority for them.  Not our country.
I live in WV I just want to know if my water is good to give to my kid I could give two craps who is figuring it out I just want the damn truth.
Yes, and it is completely devoid of leadership.  But diversity.
Fossil fuel lobbyist complains that fossil fuel-derived substances are contaminating his state. News at 11. P.S., the border isn't "open."
They're totally incompetent, but they're very diverse.
Don’t care
What about this? WHY HAS OUR GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO PROTECT OUR GRID AGAINST EMP? Because they are keeping it as an option. Does anyone really believe they will allow themselves to be prosecuted for their crimes against us? China and WEF are ready. PREPARE FOR GRID DOWN SCENARIO.
Fan we buy some diverse eggs that are cheaper?
Jean-Pierre: "We've made the most diverse administration ever" https://t.co/Szt4m4p0nQ
And that accomplishes what exactly? Absolutely nothing. They need to just select the best people for the job. Not go for blackout on the bingo card.
Representation matters
Yes. I want to be represented by AMERICANS. Just cause I’m gay I shouldn’t be handed a job cause of that. I’m an American.
They have a job because of their skills.   Not because they’re black. Or gay. Or trans. There are no bOxEs To ChEcK   The world has changed. Accept it, se we may thrive. Or you don’t want the country to thrive?
I don’t tolerate being called names. Bye
They forgot “…and incompetent…” to their qualifier.
Diverse and Useless.  Corrupt as ever to boot. Good work 
‘Stakeholders…’
And not a single one is qualified
Unfortunately not qualified
Imagine bragging about your job placement because of skin color or sex organs. Just think about that for a moment.  Qualified? Who cares.  Most accomplished? Who cares.  Saved the most taxpayer dollars? Who cares.  We have dark skin and boobs. Yaaaaay.
Diversity and competency are not the same...
I am blessed to work with a diverse and highly qualified team
If we submit a resume, do we need to include any qualifications or just our sexual preference and skin tone?
Now cite their qualifications.   Being a specific ethnicity is not a qualification. Being a specific sex is not a qualification. Having a sexual orientation is not a qualification.
Diverse or unqualified???
We've made the most diverse and less competent administration ever"   Just fixed it.
* least competent 
Everything before 1776 was great.
Do you mean 1614 or 1619 or whatever century 400 to 500 years ago? That was when you either farmed or hunted for everything you ate or else you starved. Rampant disease &amp; starvation killed most people befriend the are of 40. Child-birth was more likely to end in a dead kid &amp; mom.
Honestly, I care about COMPETENCY not an Administration simply known for its ‘first this, or first that’.
That unfortunately doesn’t fix a thing. #TrainWreck
Oh well thank god - I was REALLY  concerned about their diversity
Would love to hear them brag about actual qualifications…
Nah we are focused on that Mary sorry
Absolutely. What are you waiting for?
The most perverse administration in history?
An actual argument against hiring based on gender, sex, or orientation. Which is also illegal.
He is the President he doesn’t have to follow the laws no Dems do.
Too bad our forefathers aren't alive today... they'd find out different when they found themselves hanging from the gallows labeled as Domestic Terrorists to the United States of America. Our forefathers killed Terrorists domestic &amp; foreign even if they were part of government
Most diverse in history = A bunch of jews and some window dressing
My first reply seems to have vanished....
It’s a diverse dumpster fire
That explains a lot
Oohhh Side Show Bobbi is such a pawn…..
The scientific equation for this scenario is ... Diversity ≠ Qualified.
It's not about diversity.  It's about competitence, which this admin is not!
Proof diversity is not our strength
There are far more important things to focus on, besides this. This is about 199 of the top 200.  
Literally no one asked for that.
is a total failure!
No1 can argue that lol. Never seen so many drag queens in military uniform before. Good job 
And the worst. Not sure those things are connected, but….
And not a single competent employee, but they cheer being diverse? Not one member qualified to do the jobs they were given. Don't forget she also says Joe is the best communicator in the White House.  LMAO
It’s okay we rob you and strip you of right because Diversity! Yay!
Gathering a bunch of people who think exactly the same is quite literally the opposite of diversity.
Best thing I've read all week.
Yeah,  but  at  the  cost  of  competence.  That’s  the  problem  with  hiring  for  anything  other  than  merit.
You support trvmp but have the temerity to say anything to anyone about competence? 
You call it temerity; I call it integrity. Integrity is something sorely missing in this administration.
Guessing you don't know what temerity means. This admin had more integrity in the first 30 seconds than trvmp or any of the other criminals in it have had in their entire lives.
Of people who have no clue what they’re doing.
Which equates to the most divisive, useless &amp; dangerous
And how’s that working? Not very well, at all.
Does that stand for anti white people association
I think she meant most divisive.
The disconnect is thinking that the most diverse group is the best group. There is no relationship between the diversity of a group and the performance of a group… but they are blind to anything but the diversity aspect.
And the least qualified. Also the lost failures. But at least they can check the boxes.
Assistance from pertains to "traditional" disasters tornadoes, hurricanes “You are eligible for FEMA assistance when you have problems that aren’t covered by 3rd parties,” said Tierney. “The system is set up so taxpayers are the payers of last resort.”
The railroads are already subsidized by the taxpayer so the railroads should shoulder this expense.
Everyone in a tornado or hurricane covered by 3rd party insurance isn't covered by ?
Translation: We’ve checked off more boxes with unqualified people than any other administration.
Exactly! This administration went for diversity over appointing the most qualified for the position and it shows
But, isnt that what equity is all about? Not being able to do the job your handed because you've a token (LGBTQ +, everything else) with no qualifications.
But they’ve taken off the charts
Is Pete Butegeig, Becerra, Levine, and Brinton part of that? If so, it’s been a disaster so far. Sacrificing qualifications for diversity is a dangerous trade off. I am all for diversity but not if they aren’t capable of the job
Don’t forget mayorkas and KJP herself
Hence the dumpster fire, on fire.
they are proof why identity politics fail...clearly the most qualified or even qualified at all were not placed in those positions...right ? ? ? ?  and the list goes on and on
It completely baffles me that people believe that diversity, on its own, is some form of magical production making potion. I’m all for diversity if the people selected are competent and experienced.
exactly....best person for the job no matter the color, gender or sexual preference
I’m like… who would want a job, knowing they aren’t qualified, and knowing the only reason they were selected was because of some physical attribute and not their body of work… that seams cruel.
my thing is are they saying that is the only way they can get it bc not as good as others?
Should have said "most useless, diverse administration"!
And it's the worst administration ever. It's awful. Hire people on merit,  not skin color and sexuality.
Yes Jean-Pierre…Biden administration is the most diverse administration of people who have no idea or skills on how to do their jobs. That’s the problem with diversity hiring. Congrats!
So much baggage
And look at what it's done to the country. It's a literal train wreck!
nice pun
Yessss! Very diverse and very useless! That’s what happens when you assign jobs based on race/gender and not on qualifications
The outcome will always be the same when you value diversity and quotas over qualifications and competence. A flaming dumpster fire of ineptitude
Who cares about diversity when they’re doing a horrible job and ruining our country! These people are clowns
Exactly!!  That's why this administration is horrible.  You went with diverse people and not qualified people.  #fail
He was one of this administration favorite,loved to hear the clicking of his stilettos when,he proudly went to meetings about nuclear wasteJean Pierre, another example of someone that was installed just because she knows how to read,but mainly that she’s a good liar.
Actually they are doing a great job of ruining our country, and a lousy job of protecting our citizens and running our country
Agreed
I heard...box got checked! This is why government agencies are in chaos!
Probably why you guys have failed the American people so badly! Bragging about hiring people based on skin color and not qualifications is really low and pathetic!! You should be worried about what’s best for the country and not just what’s best for your party’s image!! 
Trudeau Government does the same
That's the best argument against diversity I've ever heard.
TOO SOON?
She spelled divisive wrong.
and look where its gotten us...
What are you going to complain about, food shortages, $8 eggs, inflation, Chinese spy aircraft, cost of gas, cost of housing, interest rates? I mean it's literally the best economy we've ever had in the history of the world. Not like Biden would lie about this stuff
One thing is for certain about this admin, they all lie.  And do with consistency.  Most People can not stand liars.
How about the most divisive Adm ever?!
We are sick and tired of the Biden administration, touting what everybody sexual preferences are that he employs. Out in the real world if someone did this, they’d get fired.
I know right? Somehow letting the "gay community" that we have filled appointments with gays and it is now assumed that you must vote Democrat is kind of bigoted, isn't it?
Then they need to get their butts out and campaign &amp; vote to change this .
And the results speak for themselves….really bad. The “business case” is a lie. Hire people that are the most qualified not based on race or sexual orientation.
If by “administration” she means “circus freak show”.
As a woman, "equality" hiring is deeply offensive to me. I want to know I was hired because I was the best and most qualified, not because I have a Vagina.  We need to stop this.
As a woman who spent her career years in male dominated fields I know I was viewed as a “token”, until I proved more than capable to be equal to the tasks and projects assigned.  I too find “equality” hires not necessarily the best choices.
I was one of the only females in my position company-wide. I was definitely under a microscope until they saw my performance.
I would more proud if it were the best qualified Administration ever.   I want the best to do the job, checking boxes is not the top indicator of talent.
Celebrate diversity folks!!!
And with the worst administration in history
Weird flex. Claiming you’ve created the most qualified and capable administration ever would be a preferred narrative.
Clowns come in every race and color. 
She says a lot of things that are untrue.
 regime!!
And the most ineffective as well
It seems their camp are the only ones tooting their own horn while the rest of us squint and scratch our heads in complete bafflement.
That’s why it’s so awful.
Diversity does not equal competence
We don’t want a “diverse” administration. We want a functional administration. This is the most dysfunctional administration in the history of our country.
If Biden picked people simply because they are diverse isn't that racist?
 yep. You’ve successfully hired a bunch of non qualified people based on race and gender.
And it hasn't worked. Maybe try hiring based on merit? Crazy enough to work...
Yeah but where are the normal people?
Crappiest maybe
Inept, disgraceful, immoral, and perverted.
Not the most competent or experienced or honest or trustworthy or principled or transparent, or law abiding or honor or sincere. Just the most diverse. I don't think diverse is in the job descriptions or oaths that were taken.
Diversity is a discourse to appease the masses. Diversity doesn’t pay bills, put food on the table or pay for health benefits. It is something created to make you, or pressure you into accept a condition that is against normal behavior.
well - Joe said half the women in it _were women.
That’s all they care about is diversity, inclusion and living in the past. This administration is obsessed with diversity so much so that we are completely divided and identity politics is destroying our country right now. This administration is a nightmare and an embarrassment!
What kind of diversity? Blk, gay, trans freaks?  A man who was a husband/dad and now believes he is a woman?!      The reprobate minds in our w.h are not my idea of diversity.    All I hear about is how much they hate white,  families.
I know. It’s absolutely shameful!
It probably is the most diverse administration ever, but it's also the least functional.
“Collect them all!”
And that’s good how?  Shouldn’t it be we made the best administration ever?  That should be the goal.
These days in America there are those who will literally refuse to hire you if they hear you say "I do not judge people by the color of their skin".  Because it's supposedly racist. Or not anti-racist. Or something...
In my life I made an effort to not work for, or with, fools but rather to seek those who serve their clients and support their employees.
The goal should have been to have a competent administration.
I guess the left has forgotten this:  "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."  Maybe someday Dr. King.
His dream has become a nightmare mostly from privileged educated whites and a few black college youth that been twisted by privileged white professors that never worked a day in there life or been outside a college setting
You’re administration is an outstanding example of why you should prioritize skill set before #diversity. This way you can have both.
I don’t see a lot of Asian people in your administration. I guess if you consider the CCP as part of the administration you have that covered.
Yep - bought &amp; paid for with a compromised DOJ.  #FJB should already be in GITMO.
But, Is it the BEST? Or are you just checking all of the boxes - we know the answer
Diversity = Guaranteed Failure
WE DONT CARE ABOUT TOUR ADMINISTRATION!!!!   WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR THOSE IN OHIO WHO CANT LIVE IN THEIR OWN TOWN!?!?
She meant to say “divisive”
And it is a disaster in every department.
Barnem and Bailey should sue all of them for gimmick infringement because it’s definitely a circus for sure 
Scraped the bottom of the barrel to do it.
So many different cookies to make… not sure I have enough dough…  #peopleCookies #theYootopian
You mean ‘most woke’. You are literally the worse choice for this position. Absolutely under qualified and that’s not because I don’t like you. You don’t even sound professional. You work hard to get to these places it’s not something you gift because of what your lifestyle is.
She said a priority? Wow, who knew that diversity is more important than functional.
The most unqualified and embarrassing admin in my lifetime. 
Your so worthless all your administration
And have proved diversity contributes nothing to competence…
Big deal it sucks ! Back to the drawing board
Without regard to ability. Complete cluster.
"We've made the most perverse administration ever"
It’s clear and concise, diversity doesn’t equate to success.
she meant to say divisive, um, you know.
She probably meant, "divisive"
Oh look, you guys made the worst administration in history, too. You guys are absolutely unbelievable!!
Never mind being qualified in any way, shape, or form.
Indeed, that’s true for once.
And look at the damage they've done.  Proof positive that affirmative action is a failed system and their ideals of equity are extremely harmful.
What a joke its worse than a b rated hollywood production
Congratufuckinlations... Now what?
Including a mop personating a press secretary
How about making the most competent administration.
I would have preferred the most competent administration ever.  I think that could administration could have still been diverse but hire for competence first.
Lmfao ok
Worst not diverse…
So Diverse it has no direction whatsoever except for DOWN
How is that going to benefit us when we are dragged into WW3 already? So much for Biden’s administration. Btw., how is she still on this job? We need Jesus!
Performance metrics are meaningless? This administration is a poor model of diversity, batting negatively statistically. To make the correction of your ideology to a common standard of ability will provide far better results, achievements and ultimately success.
All over the world! And yes these people were "voted" for.....?
Hhhmmm. Now I understand why everything goes so well and everyone is happy.
When I owned a business, I hired the person based on their experience, knowledge, and personality. Never considered what color, religion, or sex they were. Didn’t know that diversity was the qualification that trumped all the others.
It's not. That's why the Biden administration is failing.
So diversity trumps qualifications.  Is that why we had baby formula shortages, unheard of inflation, air traffic stoppages, 8$ eggs, high gas prices, Chinese spy balloons, and empty shelves?
....and did I mention that I am gay?
The biggest failure of an administration in American history.. it’s turns out people should get a position based on skills and not skin color
This approach has demonstrated the superior value of actual merit over checking of boxes..
Definitely
Diversity, of itself, delivers no benefit, just differences.  Unity is our strength.
Worst performance of any administration in my lifetime except Carter.
What would be better… Highly Qualified Staff without the need to press the issue.
Diversification of everything but  Ideas or concepts.
Proving Diversity IS NOT Strength.
Jean...You must be getting paid very well to stand there daily and lie straight to our faces. When are you going to come out that you are punking us?
A staggering accomplishment ...
No …. actually the most depraved!
Diverse or most inept administration ever
With one key exception:   Their lack of qualification to do their jobs is virtually homogenous. 
Who gives a damm about diversity when y’all decision making is piss poor..
It will be interesting to study if hiring primarily by skin color, sex or sexual choice will make us a better country in the long wrong than the countries of China, Russia, India, Middle East, AfricanNations, South and Central America, where there is little to no diversity.
 At what point will the adults start behaving like adults? May their eyes be open to the ways their pride is leading them. I pray an awakening to the office (s) in which they serve would provide a greater realization of serving the people of The United States.
Having a forced diverse administration is never the goal! She’s one example of someone in that administration among others that was never qualified to be in that role. Administrations she have the best people possible &amp; there is no quotas.
Illegitimate administration
The most obscene is what she meant to say.
Sissy. (Noun) meaning ----  Man that wants to dress up as a woman, be a woman, identifies as a woman, or likes other men.
Disproves the whole 'Diversity is Our Strength' narrative.
Diverse &lt; competence
Diversity = So What  Meritocracy = Excellence
And look where thats gotten you...
Needing a haircut....
Qualify before diversified!!
That’s awesome. Now what have you accomplished outside of looks?
Is the goal to make the most diverse administration ever, or to run the Nation really, really well?  I think most Americans thought they were voting for the latter.
Or, the most crooked at the very least .
Its bad out there. I don't care if you are Black, White, Brown, Gay or Straight, Rich or Poor we all need to cut the micro segmenting of who we are. We are Americans and we need to restore faith that when we elect representatives, they work in our collective interests vs. a few
And what a mess it is.
And now we see what *diversity* vs skills has resulted in. Thanks for playing.
And the worst
And it is doing a very sucky job.  Congrats.
For Price diverse means pure white race.
Also the most worthless Administration.
The first true thing I've heard her say
The worst administration EVER
This is the most useless government since 1975. Hands down
Ohhhh.. that’s the problem GOT IT—not
Is "diverse" a synonym for "useless"?
What she meant to say was,  "We've made the most divisive administration ever"
And the most ineffective
The goal should be  accomplishment, not diversity!
That....&amp; fifty cents gets you fifty cents &amp; an airport luggage thief!
Perhaps concentrating on "effectiveness," "performance," and "accomplishments" could be this diverse administration's next priority.
We live in a country that borrows money from China to shoot down Chinese spy balloons.   Let that sink in.
The Biden administration literally watched the spy balloon take off from China, travel to the U.S., and cross the entire country before shooting it down https://t.co/YP4rhgmV8a
He had to wait until he got permission.
That's what I figured. I'm sure Xi told Biden it was heading our way and to leave it alone if he wanted another large laundered Traitor paycheck channeled through Hunter.
But that's not what they first told us. Trust the government, okay?
So where should they have shot it down without starting a Diplomatic Incident? The USA sends weather (Intelligence) Balloons around the World too.
Pretty bad when Biased CBS exposes Buy-den Administration deception.
Hey. How about identifying markings on these #balloons similar to on the tails of aircraft. So dumb.
Is this the conspiracy where JFK Jr. shows up?  Or is that another one?  It's hard to keep up.
No cameras allowed near balloon launching pad in China’s Hainan island  “We also know that that is a facility, because there is a satellite image on Google Earth showing a balloon rigged up at that site.” https://t.co/2X6lBcMgaR
Biden doesn't know what the balloons were...but he knows they're not spy balloons from China...  But he shot em down..  What piss poor liar!
The DOD said "They were present when Trump was president, but they were undetectable." Soooo.... how does THAT work? "Undetectable" but somehow they knew they were there under Trump? Something stinks here, and it ain't Biden's underpantz this time. ~V~
Wait a minute he doesn’t know what they are but he knows they were to buy planes from China now how do you figure that one out?
My recent article was published in the Financial Express titled "Chinese Air Balloon in the realm of Geospatial Intelligence" Where I analysed the recent spy balloon from China connecting it with Geospatial
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN If CHINA G_D Forbid WAGES WAR WITH J🤡E &amp; HIS CIRCUS of Clowns Show,,who shoots down Glee Club helium balloons from 15 &amp; 16 year olds?? TAkE A GOOD LOOK in the last two yrs 🇺🇸- 🤡’S https://t.co/Iw8qHofRJx
When their glaring incompetence becomes humiliating, Trump’s their go to guy.   Afghan debacle? “It was Trump’s withdrawal plan!”  Balloons from China? “It happened under Trump!”  Mushroom cloud of toxins in PA? “Trump’s deregulation!”  The good news is no one’s buying it.
I think it might be true, else I think they would have just said "More balloons from China."
You track a slow moving surveillance balloon from when it left China, but didn't "take it out" until it completed its mission. You don't get a slap on the back for removing research balloons a week later. Any other job and you'd be fired.
After the incursion by China’s high-altitude balloon, we enhanced radar to pick up slower objects.   By doing so, we tracked three objects posing hazards to air traffic. I gave orders to take them down.  These objects were likely tied to recreation or research – not surveillance.
#USA   One of the Balloons shot down under orders from US Govt may have been a Hobby club balloon as some of them are being reported as missing over North America  This doesn't the Big White China Balloon shot over the Atlantic but others taken down later https://t.co/bmy0ClF54f
Confirmation just coming in that at $12 Balloon  shot down by a missile costing half a million dollars   Happy day for all Tax payers   Hopefully the Balloon Panic episodes are over   #USA
President Biden on Thursday said his admin still doesn’t know “exactly” what theo objects over North American airspace were – but there’s no indication they were tied to China’s spy balloon program or “surveillance vehicles” from other countries. Shoot first, ask questions later?
There is a mix of Chinese HABs and unknown origin/ unknown objects that were shot down these past few weeks, but the unknown objects were an easy kill to make Biden look good.
You know, someone should have had a visual on target to do BDA, so you would think it should have been identifiable and captured on the 8mm tape or DVD-RW.
Some of us military veterans understand that the official protocol is to positively ID any bogey as a bandit, then a hostile before going weapons free. In these past few cases USNORTHCOM/ NORAD has deviated from procedure to make Biden look good. We will never see hi-res footage.
I worked on a system called CAWS in the Intel space where I took video and removed the classified info for release by the PAO. They will strip it down to a blur.
Former intel space here as well. If we see any video from the interceptors we will get the “potato camera” footage and tell everyone this is hi-res. It will look sharp enough to fool most Americans.
Yup, when we all know, we can see people on the ground from way up high, as shown by the picture President Trump released. But I can't confirm or deny that to be true.
Only the government is allowed to do that.
I don't know, when I was in Kosovo, we filmed every shot, every bomb. That way, we could do BDA(Bomb Damage Assessment). The aircraft never flew alone. While one shot, the other filmed. Seems like this should be easy to figure out, especially with the Hi-Res cameras we have.
Guess the military forgot the 4thr ule of gun safety   4. Know Your Target (and Whatever is Behind It)
Agreed!
They are talking out both sides of their asses again.  We don’t know what they are and shot them down anyway.  We don’t know what they are or who owns them but it’s not China. 
You know, if I went into my backyard and just shot my gun and hit "something" without knowing what it was, that would be real bad for me. I expect more from our well trained military and a lot more transparency from my government!
It makes me wonder what the ROE were when dealing with this .
Good question.  I doubt anyone in the current leadership can write or articulate them.  They are to involved in drafting new social engineering protocols.
The way the president is putting it out is like shoot first ask questions later. And to not try and gather any intel from it is just crazy. I think the aircraft could probably outrun it.
Commander and Chief
Relax. He just wants to start an interplanetary war...
Americans shoot down their own balloons and say they are from China
Yes! We know that these balloons are NOT spy balloons! And, we know USA government sabotaged Nordstrom pipelines!
He never answered the question of how we were able to track similar incursions during the Trump administration.  This is a circle jerk.  Admin claims radar wasn’t set to pick up balloons.  Yet we tracked the Chinese balloon from its launch in China.  😳😳
BREAKING: John Kirby struggles to explain how administration was able to track Chinese spy balloon during administration since radar was just upgraded to track them . WATCH.
Spy balloons, UFOs, mounting tensions with Russia and China, and a pipeline scandal… If the news has you scratching your head, you’re not alone! Find comfort and encouragement from the pages of Scripture that God has everything under control!  https://t.co/HFqGJ5kPcu
My President walked into North Korea like HE OWNED IT!  Yours shits him self infront of the pope, allows China to complete spie missions, then shoots kids balloons out of the sky like he's tough 😂  can't make this up And his supporters say they have ptsd from Trump 😂
But a balloon from China can.
To be fair, Biden is providing is powerful deterrence for any high school science clubs that might try to invade America….
Weren't you screaming that the balloons WEREN'T being shot down? Pick a side.
He did, genius. He picked the side of knowing the difference between a CCP spy balloon and a tiny domestic science project, and taking the appropriate action when it would have mattered. Biden was trying to cover his incompetence by taking action now, when not warranted.  
Since when are science projects allowed to fly in commercial air space?
Funny I don't remember asking that question. I don't care about the political angles you all do I just don't think any of them should be in commercial airspace. It won't be a joke when a commerical flight hits one.
The Chinese balloon was well above commercial airspace.
Biden may have shot down a hobby club's missing balloon. https://t.co/L0nPsk4idw

And Trudeau tweet bragged about giving the order to do it.
I thought of that well, but I was talking about shooting them down
According to Tucker, he certainly has! The balloon cost $12. The missile was 400,000 to deploy. 
Exactly why it isn’t true. Our military isn’t stupid, have you seen how much of our tax dollars go to military budget?
The Biden administration is incompetent and liars. The military has to have high resolution imagery of all of the objects. They knew they were shooting down balloons, but were ordered to do so by incompetents that think we are the stupid ones.
I thought there basically was no circus anymore.  
Sounds about right 
Just another day in  
The perfect metaphor for the pandemic. A complete and ludicrously expensive overreaction to a "threat" after China hyped everyone up.
Perhaps he should hire the best and ditch the diversity hire route.
$400,000 kill shot! We got it.
OMG!  We’re so effed
What an embarrassment.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cornpop-Baloonpop-Brainfart…
How much did the flight and rocket cost to down a hobby balloon
oh  no....
These are not the size of a small car!! These would not be viewed as a threat by fighter pilots! They probably would barely view these! What did they really shoot down? Or did they shoot down anything at all?
Same story different decade #roswell #UFOs
MSM do little other than lie, so I’ll assume this is BS.   We’ll never know 
It’s true. They interview the club that the boy was in. He was 11.
WRONG. The object was reported as cylindrical and about the size of a small car. Not a clear little weather balloon.
In Biden’s defense we don’t know what those teenagers were really up to.
Joe’s a balloon
experience open
We’re past the balloons now, we know you’re in bed with China. Let’s talk about how you’re more interested in helping Ukraine than the massive chemical spill in Ohio… or are you getting kickbacks from that too??  No matter how you slice it, you’re a TRAITOR
We know that a range of entities operate objects at high altitudes for purposes that are not nefarious.    But make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down.
Democrats act on two motives: their actions buy them votes or it puts more money in their pockets!
A big lying traitor with dementia
Biden and swamp are probably taking bribes from China.. Its kind of obvious.
Traitor Joe, I like that.  I wonder if we can make that trend? 
who's in bed w/ china?
Doofus!  Did you read the Ohio governor rejected help from the Biden Administration?  "...in bed with China..." you really are a doofus.
Can't help to wonder, we're the other 3 balloons from other nations that don't like the USA, China just lead the way.
The first one was probably a balloon. MAYBE it was from China. MAYBE it was lofted by the CCP, or MAYBE by a private company. How can YOU know?  But importantly, all the USG wants is for you to say: CHINESE SPY BALLOONS  It serves them on at least 2 fronts: not-UFOs &amp; future war. https://t.co/y0K04MxqRf
Do you like balloons uncle sam? I do not like them, Sam-I-am I do not like spies or commie balloons I don't like chow mein or monsoons I would not like them here or there I would not like them anywhere UFO or stray balloon Shoot em down and do it soon.
Correct. This scans.
BREAKING NEWS! After several days of insipid nonsense, Biden has confirmed that the balloons and myriad flying objects weren’t surveillance vehicles from China or any other country. Remember, friends, this guy is the U.S. Commander in Chief! https://t.co/EgZLlq85TZ
Thank goodness
The  Biden  administration continues  to  lie.
They were from a child's birthday party.
Two more, painful years, of Biden and fellow Stooges.
And your point is?
And your point is...?
Asking you what the point of your post was. Thought that was clear.
Confirmed impact on Target CornPop! Tango Down!  You showed those weather balloons!
From Washington to this complete degenerate. Shameful.
we got inflation, shitty government and police, aliens? ,school shootings , a war in russia? , toxic chemical leaks n explosions from derailed trains and factories, plus spy balloons from china 😂?? You know just another month in America
We livin 
Fox News is suggesting the balloons were from China..
Ok, they also suggested the 2008, 2012, and 2020 election had been cheated and the election system is broken. Oddly enough the 2016 results where accurate.
😂🤣 You politicians are haunted by China. $12 hobby balloons from Illinois lead to your statement?
Joe, for 6 days you let the balloon expose our nation.  Now you say, “C’mon man, it’s probably from a private company or research institution.” We’re not idiots, those are all holed up in DC. Look at the pic below; suddenly it’s neither China nor is it the Whitehouse at fault. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/4pPGokvrUn
Hold onto your bloomers granny ole cornpop done raided Hunter's stash again!!
Yeah, somehow magically they can go back in time to say Trump era balloons existed, but they can’t track the 3 they shot down after the China balloon back to their point of origin so they can confirm some kid let them go from a Chuck-E Cheese parking lot?

Did the Air Force use F-22s and Sidewinder missiles to shoot down… three ham radio pico-balloons from the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade?  https://t.co/UXhDyO0bjh
Like with hackers, as technology advances, it’s increasingly hard to tell top secret espionage hardware from random people playing with electronics in their garage
The balloons cost $12. The electronics and solar panels cost another $200 or so.  A Sidewinder missile costs $430,000 
Now I wonder if such a small and light balloon could carry any useful spy gear. Maybe radio scanners?
Also pretty impressive that ground based radar could track these at all
And that a missile could lock on They weigh in the tens of grams!
Now I want to make a pico balloon
RIP little guy. You made it six times around the world, only to go out with a glorious bang.
If we go to war with Northern Illinois I’m gonna be so mad
Here’s a tweet thread from someone who put the evidence together almost a week ago
We’ll probably never know the truth for sure. It seems unlikely that a tiny balloon would have survived the hit in pieces big enough to be findable in extremely remote places like Alaska and Lake Huron.
Giving arrested development vibes
So have you figured out if the Chinese balloons were from China yet? Maybe if they flew over East Palatine you could have done something about that toxic cloud
After the incursion by China’s high-altitude balloon, we enhanced radar to pick up slower objects.   By doing so, we tracked three objects posing hazards to air traffic. I gave orders to take them down.  These objects were likely tied to recreation or research – not surveillance.
CONGRESS:  OKAY CONCENTRATE ON THE CHINA BALLOON NOT THE OTHERS.  They are a distraction to take away FROM THE CHINESE BALLOON.  FOCUS don't be distracted by these con men and women.
Lmfao Bloomberg got the guts to ask whether China is using Nord Stream blast &amp; Ohio train derailment to distract public attention from the balloon.

The Chinese spy balloons which came from China were shot down because they need to be shot down since they don't have any benefit that's why they got shot down. https://t.co/WWVlZZPqNS

Kamala Harris says Biden is "probably one of the boldest and strongest American presidents we have had"
He’s put China into our White House. He’s their Trojan horse and the Manchurian candidate. It’s a network. This country is in the fight for our life.
From my own understanding of China, I believe that  Dmitry Polyansky (Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN) is perfectly correct when he says that "China has lost all illusions about West":  "We have very similar views on the West. ..." --&gt;&gt;👉

A sad state.
Part of their agenda I suppose …but they can never take our pride completely
Agreed, our best has not yet surfaced.
The hour is late and  we don’t seal our fate
Joe Biden has admitted he doesn't know what the three flying objects were that the US Military shot down.  But he's now confident they weren't connected to China. #9News https://t.co/nnzPyu8jme
Check Hunters laptop. All the information you need is there
Maybe ask #U2
Even if he knew he would have forgotten!
I wonder how much China paid him to say that
Sure eggs are $8 and we buy oil from Iran &amp; Venezuela and the air &amp; water in #EastPalestineOhio are toxic and china is sending spy balloons and inflation is 7% and Mexican cartels traffic fentanyl across the open border... but at least the cabinet is a rainbow!
Color and gender is priority for them.  Not our country.

They're totally incompetent, but they're very diverse.
Don’t care
What about this? WHY HAS OUR GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO PROTECT OUR GRID AGAINST EMP? Because they are keeping it as an option. Does anyone really believe they will allow themselves to be prosecuted for their crimes against us? China and WEF are ready. PREPARE FOR GRID DOWN SCENARIO.

Unfortunately not qualified

I legit can't keep up with the stories lol  Every few hours there's something new now
May as well make them up. I heard that NZ sent a balloon up but it only made it as far as East Auckland. A copper shot it down but soon realised it was a fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital. The further it went the more $ they get. Unfortunately it only raised NZ$3:17

You are making it clear that you and Biden don't want to work to help the American people. Becomes more clear every day.
Well sense China has really not said crap or done crap about us shooting the balloon down at the finish line speaks for itself!
Shooting down a Chinese Spy Balloon after it completes it’s mission is like tackling the Quarterback after the game is over.
Hmmm...
DOD blocked it from being able to collect signals, collected intelligence from it, and shot it down when it was safe. All of the debris has been collected and is being analyzed by the FBI
The has made their stance clear about Russia
Old Indian. How?
Doubt it
So given the most complicated issue with nuclear capability is the delivery system.  China now knows to deploy nukes where the U.S. will shoot it down only to be detonated upon impact. Brilliant…
Look at that SHINY object in the sky!
Did you ever wonder what it was like to actually tell the truth?

They watched it! Did Biden serve popcorn? Worst administration ever!

Exactly
Kamala, open mouth, insert foot.
Is it a weather ballon or dot ballon  make up your mind.
It was rendered useless. It wasn’t surveilling anything as it flew across the US, and not transmitting anything back to China.
A disgusting liar !
#TrumpBlimpWimp Under President Biden, a #ChineseSpyBalloon was detected and shot down. Under Trump, three Chinese Spy Balloons travelled the US without Trump lifting a finger. Maybe they looked too much like a lied that Trump would shoot them down.

You mean the balloon that sailed freely across states that was shot down after every data was recorded that one you talking about or the kid's balloon
The world is laughing at our goverment
Kamala is about as clear  as the air over East Palestine.
As usual with this pathetic administration, you did nothing until it became an embarrassment.
What was message I guess I missed that one lol
the trump administration missed at least 3, where they not watching the country that is supposed to be our greatest enemy
i wouldn't be surprised that it was &amp; who convinced &amp; to dump &amp;   in light of all the released internal texts between &amp; it makes a lot of sense that they'd hamstring a competitor.
Idiot
The position that the Biden administration will use $400,000 dollar missile's of tax payer money.., to shoot down a balloon.. That's been crystal clear..
Lol did you actually get it?   Or are you just being a joke?
That’s not a Joke, come on man
BREAKING: the RNC has found out that China has satellites.
It wasn't even a spy balloon, even the Pentagon admitted it was just a weather balloon. Spy balloons haven't been a thing since the 50s.
That is one thing for sure this admin. Doesn't do anything quick but DIVIDE a country
the only thing you made clear with the balloons is our borders are wide open!
Later rather than sooner we shot down a balloon that had crossed the country transmitting all the way.
as clear as the air and water in East Palestine?
Imagine all the information the three balloons collected while Trumps administration was hush hush, during his short one term. I wonder what happened to missing top secret classified documents PAB took. 15 boxes confiscated
I always believed in the Department of Defense as the one department that is and will protect this country. Now I am questioning if that is true today.
#GOPLiars
I shot a balloon, yesterday, at the  county fair ...
So embarrassing and weak for our country
Right. Ridiculous
DO YOUR DAMN JOBS: #ImpeachBidenHarris
#KluelessKamala
But first we needed to call Xi for permission to shoot it down
..IT WAS - “TOO LITTLE/TOO LATE = (?)/..
Needs a dunce cap 
She is a da.
Please stop talking... Quiet when Uplifted.
Harris is an embarrassment
Everyone knows the solution to the balloon issue is to allow three, or more, balloons to traverse the country without blinking an eye.
RNC, you knew Fox News was lying And are not surprised they are PROVEN DISHONEST MEDIA ☆ you're just part of the dishonesty machine, aren't you?
Sure, sure… 
Why isn’t anyone asking why it wasn’t shot down before it flew over the USA like the other 4 objects.
Yes they made it clear. Clear to do anything with no American interference.
kamala is trash but we already know it wasn’t a “spy” balloon. unless you consider atmospheric pressure and wind speed to be invaluable top secret intelligence.  also i love that you think us watching a balloon take off from china is fine but the reverse is terrifying and illegal
They were directed to wait until the balloon had gathered the info it was sent to get. Thanks, China Joe!
She is so intelligent
…jammed its communication, gleaned intelligence from it, shot it down over the ocean to avoid injury &amp; so they could easily recover the wreckage   Trump didn’t even know spy balloons were spying on us. The good news is there was no intelligence to be found in his admin
Do democrats even talk to each other?
has never made anything clear in her life.  She's Totally unqualified and a fraud!
We made it clear that we will allow you to finish your mission then take action. Better late than not at all..... BS
We will not allow a “domain awareness gap!” Right out of Dr. Strangelove.  
You Two made America a Laughing stock!! Worst VP, ever!!
The legacy of the one term Biden Administration, they shot down balloons! 
Did she say “we”?? I know she ( Kamala) did nothing… absolutely nothing ….
Kamala are you happy China has all the locations of our Minuteman Missile silos in Montanna?
The Biden admin shot the balloon down, and yet you still complain. Trump, who gets $20 million a year from the Bank of China, let the balloons fly over the country. All you have is lies and deflection.
So you made it clear that we will bow to China. Good job. 
Just ole' Xi getting is money's worth from his Biden family investments.
Hi my name is Harris. I read off of what others write for me.
The Chinese balloon should have been shot down as it was crossing over RNC Headquarters!
Chinese spy balloon oh my god how racist can she be calling it the Chinese balloon
If they shot it down republicans would have something different to bitch about! They would say shooting it down takes us all closer to wwIII
More word salad from Harris.
How did these fools get into office
Biden likely got millions of dollars in kickbacks from China in exchange for allowing the balloon to survey the US, the military bases and nuclear plants.
You obviously have not the slightest idea what you're talking about.
You’re misinformed. As soon as Biden was informed, he contacted the military to shoot it down. They wanted to wait until it was in a safe place but jammed right away it’s communications. #StopLying Trump had 3 balloons. Did nothing. Told no one. #GOPClownShowContinues
We've made America's position on that balloon when you people spotted it put it all over Twitter and we couldn't hide it no more then we let it go all the way across the country watching everything and listening to everything and then shot it down after it got done
Isn't that what you meant to say seems like everything you touch turns to steaming pile of s***
Go Back to Digging Up Those ROOT CAUSES You've Been Looking For For Over 2 Years. You're A F--king Disgrace You need to be Impeached right along with the rest of the Biden Crime Family  NOW !!!
What an idiot
Just laughable. The Chinese and Russians are laughing at us under this administration.
Kammie...China is doing your hyena laugh at USA!
Low IQ VP
MAGA BAD RISING CHINA GOOD
Jobs jobs jobs #BidenBoom
We have white supremacists killing blacks Asian latinos gays and jews and they still not a terrorist groups los Angeles police make arrest, probe hate crimes in shootings of 2 Jewish men
Is this the conspiracy where JFK Jr. shows up?  Or is that another one?  It's hard to keep up.
She is one stupid person
That position would be bent over
Don’t listen to any republicans !! They made Fox News lie for them !!
Clueless

She's a moron
Your a joke and china is laughing at you...
Strange how CORRUPT Republicans are obsessed about balloons bc Biden is POTUS, when they didn't give 1 rat's arse about the balloons flying across the USA while Trump was despot! Was it all those money making trademarks China fast tracked for Ivanka?
People more stupid than she is cheer her on.
Unqualified impeach these idiots
Love madam vice President
In timely fashion I’ll say.
Here is my theory on the Balloon from China. https://t.co/KJZAcX3oqK
Lmao  10/10
 really good joke dude
nerdy joke ha! , i bet most people wont get this joke 
Thats a good joke 
Solid.
China couldn't find the USB port.
Biden may have shot down a hobby club's missing balloon. https://t.co/L0nPsk4idw
Read more:
And Trudeau tweet bragged about giving the order to do it.
I thought of that well, but I was talking about shooting them down
According to Tucker, he certainly has! The balloon cost $12. The missile was 400,000 to deploy. 
Exactly why it isn’t true. Our military isn’t stupid, have you seen how much of our tax dollars go to military budget?
The Biden administration is incompetent and liars. The military has to have high resolution imagery of all of the objects. They knew they were shooting down balloons, but were ordered to do so by incompetents that think we are the stupid ones.
I thought there basically was no circus anymore.  
Sounds about right 
Just another day in  
The perfect metaphor for the pandemic. A complete and ludicrously expensive overreaction to a "threat" after China hyped everyone up.
Perhaps he should hire the best and ditch the diversity hire route.
$400,000 kill shot! We got it.
OMG!  We’re so effed
What an embarrassment.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cornpop-Baloonpop-Brainfart…
How much did the flight and rocket cost to down a hobby balloon
oh  no....
These are not the size of a small car!! These would not be viewed as a threat by fighter pilots! They probably would barely view these! What did they really shoot down? Or did they shoot down anything at all?
Same story different decade #roswell #UFOs
This Bottlecap Balloon Brigade had the opportunity to contact someone that it belonged to them long before it was shot down.
MSM do little other than lie, so I’ll assume this is BS.   We’ll never know 
It’s true. They interview the club that the boy was in. He was 11.
WRONG. The object was reported as cylindrical and about the size of a small car. Not a clear little weather balloon.
In Biden’s defense we don’t know what those teenagers were really up to.
Joe’s a balloon
experience open
NEW: Satellite images apparently show a balloon launch facility on China’s Hainan island, identified by American intelligence as the site where China's spy balloon that lingered over the U.S. was launched from. https://t.co/mGQWhqv2UD  📷: Planet Labs https://t.co/5U2E4t6OVb
Bulls eyes 
Now That's !!! The America  That I Know 
Walk into the sea do not return
Report on men in women’s prisons 
But they are just left overs from car dealerships...
wow, concerning stuff! say, how'd the US get this image? and can you think of any other countries with similar technology that could maybe leverage it instead of a "spy" balloon?
this is like a fully geared up SWAT team standing around a hash pipe they confiscated
I sure hope nothing bad happens to it in the middle of the night.
Okay?
Like they think we're not going to figure it out?
ELectrical Grid at risk.
American Intelligence 
I heard news of balloons belonging to a company not any country. If so true why hasn't the company spoke up? I believe it is a big cover up to calm our fears of possibly being attacked.
The irony of this post 
They are evil!!!
Home sweet home!
What about that environmental disaster in Ohio. Not much being said about that...
We spy , they spy. Same games.
lol, you know where it was launched from buy you couldn’t track it because it was moving to slow - lolol. BTW did anyone in “Intelligence” ever say “Hey Guys do think our enemies would ever spy on us with a device disguised as a Weather Balloon?” Nah, never happen.
I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.  I’m looking at you.  You’re looking at me.
 Sounds like one of those Iraqi mobile chemical labs. Suuuure, we totally believe in American intelligence. 
Turn the fans on DookyJoe, blow it back.....
Funny I don't hear an apology or redaction in this title
Thank goodness for Google maps So can we all agree to be good and stop fear mongering? Asking for a friend and all the frightened children across the world, who shouldn’t be watching scary #ChineseSpyBallon TikTok videos. #balloongate
Next you can report on their newly constructed Clown College. Maybe you guys can apply for a scholarship?
Don't expect Joe Biden to say something bad about China..
Lingered for 6 days...
#spyballoon #ChinaSpyBalloon
. BREAKING NEWS: #Platform LAUNCH
MSNBC, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS and the rest are ALL owned by the same 6 LEFTIST Corps.  They are a bunch of LYING, worthless, sell-outs in American HISTORY !!  There are HUNDREDS  of such examples exposing this ANTI-AMERICAN treacherous behavior.
TRUMPS DISNEYLAND.
This is the greatest surprise all my life to wake up and receive $16,000 out of $1000 investment after so many tries I finally found a Legit platform for investment. All thanks to Mrs for making this possible.
Does china have access to these insane satellites or do they need to send fucking 1920s balloons? Fuck off, propaganda rag
I'm still living well, all thanks to Marwah for providing a legit paying platform for me andalso delivering a wonderful trade $13,000 received successfully Contact him for more details
Balloons can blow in the wind dipshits
Do you believe that Air BalloonS are From CIA USA MADE, NOT CHINA?
Did you know that this distraction is just that, and if people actually did some research they'd find that the US has 1,100+ balloons above USCities..? Ignorance is Bliss, what is the next Distraction after train derailments and disasters? 
She also indicated he's a racist and owned by China. He's good with hobby balloons. Can't take that away from him.
Kamala Harris says Biden is "probably one of the boldest and strongest American presidents we have had"
He’s put China into our White House. He’s their Trojan horse and the Manchurian candidate. It’s a network. This country is in the fight for our life.
From my own understanding of China, I believe that  Dmitry Polyansky (Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN) is perfectly correct when he says that "China has lost all illusions about West":  "We have very similar views on the West. ..." --&gt;&gt;👉
"... Although China has major investment and economic interests there, the illusions that had existed a few years ago to the effect the West can somehow treat China differently and that not everything is so bad have now vanished. ... " --&gt;&gt;
"... The Chinese have realized perfectly well what the West is really up to.  ... "The West, by its actions over the past three or four years, has actually left no illusions that instead of equal cooperation the only thing that it has in mind is harsh and uncivilized... --&gt;&gt;
" ...competition with China, Russia, India, Brazil and other countries. The Chinese are well aware of that. The way I see it, this understanding is maturing in other countries, too." (TASS)  China is VERY tired of uncivilized manners and lies of the West. Other countries as well.
There was massive goodwill capital that the west had around the world in developing nations that they have thrown away since the fall of the USSR.  I have been horrified how Aust has damaged its massive pool of goodwill with China since 2015, this GW was worth 000's of billions
In 2009, Obama forced Australia to change its China policy. Australia’s suicidal actions started already back then, and China really tried to have patience for a long time before being totally fed up and gave up.
I think it is possible that China are giving Aust a second chance with the change of Govt but I don't think China will be as patient this time round. Alt they are being pragmatic &amp; they are using the change of govt for an apparent reset while developing alt supply chains
The moment of the disillusionment for most Chinese people was the arrest of Huawei Princess in 2018 during transit in Vancouver airport. When power and wealth couldn't protect Ms. Meng Wanzhou, everyone else was vulnerable.
It was an eye opener, wasn’t it?
I'm sure they have. Read a tweet yesterday stating Brazil has now decided to support Ukraine &amp; looks to join OECD. Opinion much appreciated.
It breaks my heart that the lands built by great men have been taken over by vampire like beings, and that the modern western man with power has taken the bribe from these vampires to betray the entire world.
Chinese are pretty cautious and they backbite Russia.  They don't care much about Russia but yes provocations from US has made them kinda angry. But If US is clever they can use China to kill Russia's economy .
Personally, I don't believe China have that interest. For China, Russia is a key player for diplomacy with some other important countries. For instance, Ru has calmed down the tensions between India and China. They need to cooperate to obliterate US hegemony and the Petrodollar.
I've seen many shills spout nonsense about China not caring or being wary of Russia. On reddit and over here, they all smell like 3LA thugs.
When a powerful country counters a threat from an unfazed China spy balloon by showing our might by shooting down three wondering innocent weather balloons navigating above historic trails, waterways and roads in the United States. https://t.co/iaQBhbILCC
Doesn’t feel so powerful anymore
A sad state.
Part of their agenda I suppose …but they can never take our pride completely
Agreed, our best has not yet surfaced.
The hour is late and  we don’t seal our fate
Literally became the laughingstock of the world.  All our former military strength has been weakened. But damn, we are diverse and inclusive.  So sick of this shit.
Joe Biden has admitted he doesn't know what the three flying objects were that the US Military shot down.  But he's now confident they weren't connected to China. #9News https://t.co/nnzPyu8jme
Check Hunters laptop. All the information you need is there
Maybe ask #U2
Even if he knew he would have forgotten!
I wonder how much China paid him to say that
No surprise there - Joe Biden seems to be clueless about most things.  #9news
Joe Biden doesn’t know anything. Except he knows for sure they were definitely Chinese balloons and he’s too scared to admit it
Which Joe is speaking
I'm sorry but Joe Biden doesn't know what day it is. Bless.
😂🤣 You politicians are haunted by China. $12 hobby balloons from Illinois lead to your statement?
We live in a country that borrows money from China to shoot down Chinese spy balloons.   Let that sink in.
No cameras allowed near balloon launching pad in China’s Hainan island  “We also know that that is a facility, because there is a satellite image on Google Earth showing a balloon rigged up at that site.” https://t.co/2X6lBcMgaR
I make no judgements, but it strikes me as somewhat ironic that we are panicking about Chinese balloons violating our airspace when anyone with access to Google can see an aerial view of their balloons on the ground in China.
Biden doesn't know what the balloons were...but he knows they're not spy balloons from China...  But he shot em down..  What piss poor liar!
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN If CHINA G_D Forbid WAGES WAR WITH J🤡E &amp; HIS CIRCUS of Clowns Show,,who shoots down Glee Club helium balloons from 15 &amp; 16 year olds?? TAkE A GOOD LOOK in the last two yrs 🇺🇸- 🤡’S https://t.co/Iw8qHofRJx
THIS COUNTRY has gone to H£LL on B|DEN’S Border TO FENTANYL Flooding our YOUTH!! Look At Chicago’s OHARE AIRPORT Over crowded with HOMELESS while ’s feel UNSAFE!!!! This entire Pelosi, Schumer CHANGE  SH_T SHOW is where we stand! OMG. It’s been TWO YRS. Of H£LL, What NEXT??
I think it might be true, else I think they would have just said "More balloons from China."
You are wrong.  The fist balloon was china's. Maybe? Other objects are distractions. From #NordstreamSabotage did it. That's an act of war against Russia and NATO. the #BidenCrimeFamily investigations.
China should be the No. 1 suspect behind aerial objects
#USA   One of the Balloons shot down under orders from US Govt may have been a Hobby club balloon as some of them are being reported as missing over North America  This doesn't the Big White China Balloon shot over the Atlantic but others taken down later https://t.co/bmy0ClF54f
Confirmation just coming in that at $12 Balloon  shot down by a missile costing half a million dollars   Happy day for all Tax payers   Hopefully the Balloon Panic episodes are over   #USA
Nice job, Joe Biden
How’s the Armed Services Committee going?
Oh, you’d like to talk about military spending?
“He didn’t shoot the balloon down fast enough!”  “He didn’t take his time before shooting the balloon down!”   
The US was tracking Chinese Spy Balloon shortly after launch &amp; before it got to Alaska. They let it traverse the entire US &amp; accomplish its mission; *huge* mistake.   This was a major national embarrassment.  So shooting down some random hobby balloons doesn't make up for it.
You seem like a reasonably intelligent person; certainly you have heard of satellites? And certainly by now you heard the DoD was aware of the balloon the whole time, jammed it’s transmissions and watched its path to learn more of its intent.
Wasn't this the Lake Huron balloon? The one that took two tries to hit? And the one that the pilots allegedly reported interfered with F-22 onboard sensors (according to media reports)?
you  Hawley are a disgrace.  GROW THE HELL UP!!
Maybe you should watch a variety of news casts. If you haven’t been informed of this yet, you’re definitely watching the wrong people!
Josh Hawley wrote {referring to students who "believe" US shot down their balloon} "Nice job, Joe Biden" YOU are a senator, not a barroom brawler.  This is hateful, obnoxious and unbecoming of a man or your abilities.  How about waiting until you know for sure.  !!! !!!
That sounds right for this inept admin...
This is priceless if true.
This is what happens when you count mail and ballots, multiple times, instead of real votes.
and how many millions for the planes to fly there
Run along josh
400k missile to shoot down a $20 balloon. Or was this the balloon that took two missiles to take down?
I’m going to bet you weren’t very popular in school.
Josh - keep up the good work, big fan..
It was in commercial airspace and a danger to commercial .  Nothing Biden does satisfies you—don’t shoot balloon down right away, bad. Do shoot balloon down right away, bad. You’re a disgrace to your office.
Above 400 ft permission is required from the FAA. Sounds like they skipped that.
Missouri taxpayers might have to pay $300,000 for open records violation under Hawley
We have way too much faith in our gov , to both defend us, and identify threats. Gov had no idea 9/11 could happen, and wasn’t prepared for an attack like that.
Can’t expect anything from this President that is correct.
You were calling for him to do this, Ace. You demanded he do this.
What was your vote on the Transportation Package again? Did you agree with tRump and work with his administration to deregulate and scale back RR reporting of transporting hazardous materials? This is not on Biden, this is on Republicans.
Dont worry, someone has to do it while you run away. 
Hey Virginian...how about we look into your financials?
The same people that were in a rage over the objects are now going to be happy about this.
time to impeach is getting ridiculous
Isn't that the balloon that needed two missile's to bring it down?
Hawley, don’t you to head out for your daily jog?
Never underestimate a Biden...
Too funny-could they not see it was not that big!!
Get rid of #HaulinHawley! It’s time for
After weeks of the GOP whining about balloons not being shot down they have now moved onto whining about balloons being shot down.
You think ignoring the military is wise??
Whining that he didn't shoot it down fast enough, and then switching it up to he over reacted almost as fast as you ran on January 6th.
Josh: Biden didn't shoot down the balloon fast enough.  Also Josh: Biden shot down an object too quickly.  Change your last name to Hypocrisy, Josh.
I'm scared now to let my kid fly his kite.
Don’t you have somewhere to RUN off to?
What’s the cost of a commercail Air liner running into it?  Or did you forget the part it was determined to be a hazard to aircraft?
Why is Josh Hawley always running from truth?
Let’s be honest: you would have decried the Biden Administration for not shooting it down faster if they made a different decision.
The riot you incited hit taxpayers for millions
Got his info from the military.  Do you hate our military now?  Wow.  How unpatriotic of you.
.  is doing great.  on the other hand will complain regardless of what he does.  Only thing he could do to improve is to tell you to GFY.
Satire.
Republicans panicked for a week over a $15 Balloon Josh?
"Nice Job, Joe Biden"
#toast
Oh shut up Fistpump McRunpants. Regardless of what he did you would still be squealing like a coward.
Should I be alarmed that some recreational balloon enthusiast group regularly deploys balloons capable of reaching the same altitude as commercial aircraft? Any thought as to the dangers or possibilities such a balloon could be sucked into a jet engine and cause problems? Anyone?
Just admit it. You won’t give him credit for anything. If he waits too long that’s an issue. If he shoots too soon that’s a problem. Try being quiet for once
Hmmm we detect smaller objects in orbit to protect the space station but we can’t identify balloons….something doesn’t seem quite right.
#JogHallway
I’m voting for Biden..
Keep looking over your shoulder josh, those foot steps coming up behind you might be you supporters, you may need to run away again, from them!
Running to both sides of the issue
Isn't that what you wanted?
Yet, if he didn’t shoot it down, Republicans would be in an uproar about it…hypocrites
This you?
Introduce legislation for any balloon over certain size and carrying payload to have transponder/ID mechanism and federal registration.  Could have easily interfered with commercial airflights.
Bad if you so, bad if you don’t. The #Hypocrisy   Run Josh Run!
I believe it was my balloon from ‘THE GOP IS DESTROYING AMERICA’ parade.   The cost of that balloon - Democracy.
Hahahaha
Your obsession with balloons reminds me of someone
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Run, Josh, Run! See Josh Run!
I don't believe this but, let me ask what should he do? Wait till they can be certain, which you said was bad, or shoot it down right away, which you now say is bad. Maybe the problem is you.
Traitor
Can someone explain to me why you couldn’t take out a balloon with a bullet? I could do it with my bow and arrow if it was low enough.
Run Josh run your shadow is in front of you
Can’t have it both ways loser.
Better safe than sorry, chuckles. 
Another full day of work for Josh, mudslinging and deflecting.
Give it up Hawley.....TRUMP LOST..AND YOUR SHOT AT THE WH went up in smoke....
Run chicken , run !
 #GOPClownShowContinues
So before you were complaining he wasn't doing anything and then this comment ? I guess you're never satisfied. Or your wife.
“Deadeye Biden “
Wait until you hear how much this cost.
Thank you Josh Hawkeye for your service and professional expertise, tirelessly work ethics your line of work. I so much appreciate it!
Last week you were screaming that he didn't shoot them down fast enough. Now your hypocritical lying self says he shot them down too quickly.  Pick a lie, Josh, and stick with it, you sad coward. You don't deserve to be in the Senate. You embarrass the nation.
That’s cute coming from the “shoot it down” crowd
Yes Mr President, thank you for protecting our skies. I am in planes every week. Good looking out for us
Joshy Henlay calls for a full Congressional Investigation into the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade and how it impacted Missouri !!!
POWER TO THE PROUD BOYS, AMIRITE
This you? Run along...
Do you do anything to solve problems, but make comments from cheap seats ?
First you complain when it’s not shot down, &amp; you still complain when it is. Make up your mind, traitor. The criminal hypocrisy is astounding. #GOPTraitorsToDemocracy #JoshHawleyIsaTRAITOR Vote for
You are pathetic
You're such a joke.
Didn't last week you say.......never mind Gomer, never mind. Next!
For days all we heard is there's something in the sky shoot it down shoot it down so now there's something in the sky he shoots it down and you're like nice job Biden.
Your tweets aren't worth reading.
You are going to whine no matter what.
You wanted the balloons the shot down.
Come out…
No matter what else is going on in the world YOU will always be known as the seditious coward that you are.
Please, we can see your hypocrisy.
Run josh run 
Damned if you do damned if you don't
Should he have run from them?
Actually he's doing a very nice job. Which is so much more than anyone can say for you and your Rethuglican cohorts. BTW... got those running shoes ready?
That’s what happens when your balloons became a hazard to commercial/military flight. What you you have said it it was not shot down?  Hypocrite
If you gQpers hadn't made such a big deal of 1 balloon, maybe a big reaction wouldn't be used!! Although, I doubt it has anything to appease you all!
Run chicken little run
GOP: BiDeN ShOuLd ShOOt DoWn tHe baLLoOn!   Biden shoots down the balloon  GOP: BiDeN sHoUld’Nt ‘uVe ShOt DoWn ThE bALLooN!
Glad you approve bright boy
Not to mention the jet fuel and the carbon put into the atmosphere.
So it’s obvious that nothing he does pleases you.
It believes is not good enough.
You cry if he does; you cry if he doesn’t. You’re a fast running cry baby.
Traitor to our Constitution criticizing a President protecting the national security. You are a disgrace.
Nice job Josh Hawley aka Hawl’n Josh
Fence riding loser Josh wanted a pardon.
Your mockery would have happened no matter what transpired. Why do you hate America?
It's got to be weird knowing before you even declare your candidacy that you won't carry a single state.
What do you expect them to do?  You rag on them for not shooting stuff down.  Then you rag on them for shooting stuff down.  Here’s a Twitter fact…you don’t have to tweet about EVERYTHING.  
Weren’t you one of the guys screaming shoot it down for a week?
Aren’t you the guy who ran away from the peaceful visitors on #Jan6th ?
I remember even if you pretend you don’t.
Oh no, not the Northern Illinois Bottle cap Balloon Brigade. The horror. Thank goodness Hawley’s on the case.
Biden has been a Great American President
Run, Hawley, run.
You really just responded to the NIBBB?
Traitor.
You thought the sky was falling.  Keep running.
Which is it josh, shoot or not?
Proof or shut up. Please come to KC, we have things to discuss you worthless excuse for, well, anything.
So your telling me a military pilot with millions of dollars of training and 20/20 vision just went ahead and pulled trigger on a mylar balloon like a birthday balloon? Yeah okay...
Your propaganda station lies as much as you
See josh Run  Run josh run
We're you going to run it down? #coward
Damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.
Heard Hawlen’ Hawley was hiding under a desk.
Nope. You can’t have it both ways. You’ve gone from  we have r
Pick one bro...protect the sky or not protect?
With a 500k missile
Shouts things down too slowly, Hawley complains; shoots things down too quickly, Hawley complains. Hawley complains.
Run run as fast as you can
Fascist Josh Hawley.
both sides of your mouth Josh
Said nobody ever.
Uh, you are a traitor. You should have kept running.
Must have been one strong ass westerly wind to get there from Illinois.
For such an Alpha male you sure whine a lot. I know 3yr olds that whine less than you.
At least he doesn't run away
This will be the nice job
nice one air force, nice one little biden. nice one mayor pete
Joe Bidens America 
Puhleeze. Shut up
Don't you have a track meet to run to?
So don't shoot the balloons down?
LOL Milquetoast loser has something to say.
You are so worthless
That's PRESIDENT Biden to YOU, you treasonous little snatch.
Next, he'll have the Navy kick over sand caztles.
which is it, Josh? You were crying that he didn't shoot it down fast enough. Now you're crying that he shot it down? You're just a cry baby, that's all...
#HawlinAss
Run away coward
dang. you really are a hypocrite.
It posed a danger to commercial aircraft. Should not have been there.
There goes Josh again, pointing blame but not taking a leadership role. Waiting on another coat tail to come by so you can catch a ride.
Oh...you mean the balloon that the GOP was hyperventilating about because it might be carrying virus direct from Wuhan to dump on America? THAT balloon?
Now do your guy. The one that didn’t shoot down any. Wonder if that’s what the $$ in his Chinese bank account was for. Just asking questions.
instead Biden could have sent that $400000 to Ukraine
How embarrassing.
You screamed shoot down balloons!  Your fault hypocrite master.
This is still funny
Just you be quiet, and wait for your subpoena like all the other insurrectionists.
Guess the bottle cap peeps better learn FAA rules.
It's tough to keep your stories straight when just spend time trying to be relevant. Demand to open up a hearing!
Both!
Not do the cost of lives lost if it had crashed a commercial flight.
This…Josh Hawley
Hell of a lot better than you've done...been practicing track and field since Jan 6th???
Americans shoot down their own balloons and say they are from China
Yes! We know that these balloons are NOT spy balloons! And, we know USA government sabotaged Nordstrom pipelines!
He never answered the question of how we were able to track similar incursions during the Trump administration.  This is a circle jerk.  Admin claims radar wasn’t set to pick up balloons.  Yet we tracked the Chinese balloon from its launch in China.  😳😳
BREAKING: John Kirby struggles to explain how administration was able to track Chinese spy balloon during administration since radar was just upgraded to track them . WATCH.
Lol, such a tough guy. Let the China balloon fly for a week and did nothing. But shot weather balloons, including one from a group of fathers and sons that do it as a weekend activity. A $12 balloon! Downed by the mighty big guy with a $400,000 plus missile.  People laugh at you
In two years, we’ve created 800,000 manufacturing jobs – and we’re on track to create thousands more.    America is back – let’s finish the job.
Suspension of communication lines between the United States and China Completion of recovery of wreckage from China's spy balloon
Here is my theory on the Balloon from China. https://t.co/TmsMokCE8e
Masterful joke.  Haha.  
My President walked into North Korea like HE OWNED IT!  Yours shits him self infront of the pope, allows China to complete spie missions, then shoots kids balloons out of the sky like he's tough 😂  can't make this up And his supporters say they have ptsd from Trump 😂
Curious about #UFOs #Balloons #Drones #China and #WhatTheHeckIsAUAP? Start your weekend with this lively podcast from  and our own #airlaw #spacelaw https://t.co/hRPSBGV2Rr
The first one was probably a balloon. MAYBE it was from China. MAYBE it was lofted by the CCP, or MAYBE by a private company. How can YOU know?  But importantly, all the USG wants is for you to say: CHINESE SPY BALLOONS  It serves them on at least 2 fronts: not-UFOs &amp; future war. https://t.co/y0K04MxqRf
Best way to counter it is by calling attention to it &amp; maybe, depending on your audience, offering up consciousness elevating suggestions. As you have been doing. Honestly, keep on keepin on, man. You're doing brilliantly!
And you keep on putting out this positiveenergy. There's nothing quite like a person who can selflessly hand out kindnesses the way you have here.   Keep up the beautiful work friend 
Just calling it as I see it, brother.  Namaste 
It's so obviously spin, but what has been hard to tell. This is the first I've come across that makes sense. In fact..... immediate sense and like now seem obvious after reading the tweet.  On that note, I do not concent at all.
Do you like balloons uncle sam? I do not like them, Sam-I-am I do not like spies or commie balloons I don't like chow mein or monsoons I would not like them here or there I would not like them anywhere UFO or stray balloon Shoot em down and do it soon.
Correct. This scans.
BREAKING NEWS! After several days of insipid nonsense, Biden has confirmed that the balloons and myriad flying objects weren’t surveillance vehicles from China or any other country. Remember, friends, this guy is the U.S. Commander in Chief! https://t.co/EgZLlq85TZ
Thank goodness
The  Biden  administration continues  to  lie.
They were from a child's birthday party.
Two more, painful years, of Biden and fellow Stooges.
And your point is?
And your point is...?
Asking you what the point of your post was. Thought that was clear.
Confirmed impact on Target CornPop! Tango Down!  You showed those weather balloons!
From Washington to this complete degenerate. Shameful.
After the #Pentagon sources confirmed it was a #Spyballoon from #China and decided against shooting it down for safety reasons, with immediate escalations, the Chinese Daily said the spy balloon claims were a lie  https://t.co/AutPPx3dLC
Biden basically admitted he shot down "recreation[al]" balloons to look tough after failing to shoot down a military balloon from Communist China until it finished spying on sensitive military installations across the continental United States https://t.co/XHXSryDaaP
I really wanted ET
I have a friend on Facebook that shared this image and was put in Facebook jail for 90 days
Not just basically…that’s what he said.
BrianFL -- please followback...
Every traitor will have their day... Bidens coming soon.
Because China was probably employed by the Feds as "contractors" to spy on Americans.
Whole new meaning to the word dope…
and embarrassed the military.
The ballon reportedly said “Owww. WTF?”
I was put in Facebook jail for this photo.
And the followers of his won’t even notice that detail… they’ll just nod and think it sounds tough!
400k missile used on a $12 hobby balloon 
Biden’s legacy
Biden will continue to fail miserably at every critical turn in his “presidency”.  He is endlessly doomed, in fact, Biden was done before he started. Enjoy the show.    
In my opinion that was a given., too coincidental. I’m still of the belief the balloons were launched from a military base in Adak Alaska. The wind trajectory runs them through the North of Alaska-Canada then South following wind patterns created by the Rocky Mountains. #FJBiden
No shit! Afghanistan fubar 2.0. Biden embarrasses America on the world stage once again.
No recreational balloons in that region, Biden had them dispatched from a US Military Base, that’s why they can’t and won’t be found for discovery. More EGG on ByDumbs face!
Paul Sperry your takes are always very partisan are you a real reporter?
Total incompetence from this administration…dead whales, toxic derailments, $400k missiles targeting weather balloons, 13 military killed/Americans left in Pakistan, more border crossings in 2 years in history, inflation all time high.  But don’t worry, Biden’s plan is working!
To the tune of how many hundreds of thousands? I can’t believe the blind that still back this installed criminal imbecile
US officials now admit it was a Chinese weather balloon pushed into US by a weather system. DOD and WH knew this the whole time. Fake spy balloon nonsense.
DID scrambled it from collecting signals and studied it before shooting it down. You missed three balloons from China when you were in the White House
Some people are asking, what could these balloons possibly do? As former CIA Director, I can tell you the answer is: a lot.  A CCP balloon over our military sites is a big deal.
Fox News is suggesting the balloons were from China..
Ok, they also suggested the 2008, 2012, and 2020 election had been cheated and the election system is broken. Oddly enough the 2016 results where accurate.
Joe, for 6 days you let the balloon expose our nation.  Now you say, “C’mon man, it’s probably from a private company or research institution.” We’re not idiots, those are all holed up in DC. Look at the pic below; suddenly it’s neither China nor is it the Whitehouse at fault. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/4pPGokvrUn
Yeah, somehow magically they can go back in time to say Trump era balloons existed, but they can’t track the 3 they shot down after the China balloon back to their point of origin so they can confirm some kid let them go from a Chuck-E Cheese parking lot?
This from one of loudest monkeys hooting and hollering for a confrontation with "China" over spy balloons a week ago
The Biden administration literally watched the spy balloon take off from China, travel to the U.S., and cross the entire country before shooting it down https://t.co/YP4rhgmV8a
Did the Air Force use F-22s and Sidewinder missiles to shoot down… three ham radio pico-balloons from the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade?  https://t.co/UXhDyO0bjh
This is possibly the funniest punchline I’ve ever seen 
What a fun hobby! I hope they don’t get prosecuted or anything 
Like with hackers, as technology advances, it’s increasingly hard to tell top secret espionage hardware from random people playing with electronics in their garage
The balloons cost $12. The electronics and solar panels cost another $200 or so.  A Sidewinder missile costs $430,000 
Now I wonder if such a small and light balloon could carry any useful spy gear. Maybe radio scanners?
Also pretty impressive that ground based radar could track these at all
And that a missile could lock on They weigh in the tens of grams!
Now I want to make a pico balloon
RIP little guy. You made it six times around the world, only to go out with a glorious bang.
If we go to war with Northern Illinois I’m gonna be so mad
Here’s a tweet thread from someone who put the evidence together almost a week ago
We’ll probably never know the truth for sure. It seems unlikely that a tiny balloon would have survived the hit in pieces big enough to be findable in extremely remote places like Alaska and Lake Huron.
My recent article was published in the Financial Express titled "Chinese Air Balloon in the realm of Geospatial Intelligence" Where I analysed the recent spy balloon from China connecting it with Geospatial
Seriously.  It's 2023. A spy balloon.   Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous? Ppl can hack into your phone or speakers to film or record you, or read your phone screen from a satelite, or use a remote drone - but China chose a spy balloon?   Allrightythen.
Pentagon has invested Taxpayer dollars into balloons!
Somebody explain to me how the administration doesn't know what those objects are they've been shooting down but we can be sure they aren't from China? For all we know they're shooting down birthday balloons and kites.
You can bet those balloons were from China, by way of Amazon.
The first one was real.
That's the one that did the damage and Joe sat on his thumb while it collected Intel on our military and missle systems. What a jerk!
Suddenly a relatively harmless balloon from China became the latest small cache of weapons becoming earth-dooming weapons of mass destruction. https://t.co/sWmWZzqcs1

Which country?
Source of the video please?
What country is this and source perhaps?
Funny!
Satteloons dropping down everywhere 
send this equipments to America Embassy
Aren't these panels under the balloon? how do they get the sunlight?
Eles estão falando português do Brasil. Um deles pede uma faca.
they are speaking in brazilian portuguese   
from "china"
Internet service falling right out of the sky.
I thought satellites in space did this?
it says... made in china... hahaha
There's paperwork affixed to the payload which indicates it's not spy related, which would have no markings.  All we need is for one of those brazilians to take some images of the documentation.
Countries have started shooting down Chinese balloons all over the world. It's something new.
Those solar panels are not as large or in the same configuration as the Chinese one over South Carolina.
Japan has urged China to prevent "balloon-shaped flying objects" from making unauthorized entries into Japan's territory. https://t.co/8kajDTXVPR
Japan:  "No more balloon-shaped flying objects."    China:  "OK"   (An hour later over Japan) 
You came and talk , niceeeee some times a warrior don't need to use a sword or a bullet
IF... no longer wants to be left on the side-lines when critical talk..Or critical decision be taken... should treat..Other country with #Consideration...(.Not show an ill treatment..)
Yes.. other shaped flying objects should be fine.
Weather balloons are 15 bucks on Amazon. Probably do come from China though.
Oopsy
Inside China’s Military Balloon Program  “…for decades…The Chinese Communist Party has long vied for dominance in ‘near space,’ which Chinese scientists see as a region for a variety of applications, from high-altitude balloons to hypersonic missiles.”  https://t.co/5aVARIhV8z
A balloon is a silent killer when we have stealth technology  Look up the Korean War and see what a war with China will be
For when you can't quite get there
"near space" is where most of my High School students live most of the day
Low tech v.s. old Joe
WW3 is coming
Now they know they can flood our sky with cheap balloons and distract our military
If Biden let’s them float across the country it is a great way for them to drop massive amounts of neurological agents over large swaths of major cities.

Tucker Carlson confession:  He told his producer Trump is 'the undisputed world champion' of destroying things &amp; could ruin Fox News if it didn't back his election lies.  So he lied for Trump &amp; duped the people who listen to him, to save his own weak ass.
Japan is debating the appropriate response to tackle such surveillance following the U.S. shootdown of a balloon from China.   https://t.co/SC0mWs7Crc

"What Biden Appears to Have Shot Down Is Clown-Show Stuff" The three balloons that were shot down don't appear to have been from China, but from local weather buffs. This is embarrassing. https://t.co/XTxxqgWnp0
$800,000 to shoot down a $20 hobbyist balloon. You can't make this stuff up.
Exactly.
$12 balloon, $400,000 sidewinder. Seems legit
Right?
That's right, you can't.
I don’t believe it. Not even if I saw proof with my own eyes.
So we shot down some hobby balloons to try and look tough after we let a real spy balloon from China map the country? Got it.
Im sure we surpassed even their highest expectations
China ain’t the only one using stratollites for high altitude surveillance. World View Enterprises from US have been selling real time, high res imaging with up yo 15cm resolution of your back yard from 75000 feet. Wecome to the panopticon https://t.co/2E6kmCuw3w
Secretary Blinken met with China’s top diplomat this weekend.  Blinken should have demanded an answer from Wang Yi on why a CCP surveillance balloon was in our airspace before any discussion began.
“How Not to Negotiate Diplomacy 101”
Secretary of State Blinken needs to be held accountable about the Chinese spy balloons hovering over our air space!
Weakness  Let me talk to them
Pump the brakes there crazy-pants.
He probably gave the Chinese money for their balloon
and Trump was when he was in office, and he was Putin's top operative
Shoulda, coulda, woulda!!
If Blinken said it was raining Yi would need to look outside to verify it.
It's too late. American and western weaknesses already brought them to your doorstep.
BDS the CCP the now.  Get their companies get out of Wall Street.  Not fair to the others.  Not “Equitable”.
Mind your own business woman and get back in the kitchen where you belong. You ain’t doin a bit a good with what you’re doing now .. go on now scoot! Check your bread before it burns
Sit down karen
Blinken is spineless, weak and dishonest.
Yeah…that definitely didn’t happen.  Especially with SECSTATE Obsequious walking point.
Do actual adults ever talk to whoever runs this twitter feed?
Be quiet.
It was probably a PLA balloon, but what would you know about geopolitics?
You...don't know why the Chinese sent a surveillance balloon? (sigh)
You forgot to mention the green lasers they used over hawaii
How much you wanna bet Blinkin apologized for shooting down their balloon
Mean while in Tennessee,  streets are being named for seditious traitors.
there might just be a reason you in your position and Mr. Blinkin is in the position he is in, I think we should keep that the way it is.
How do you he didn’t ??
It is not your call as to what he discusses. When you become SOS then you get to make demands and ask questions.
"Taiwans" lol
This you?
And Trump should have demanded accountability from the Saudis over the killing of Khashoggi, but he didn't.
Freeze in 1982, Reagan blew the biggest hole in deficit history , 184% increase , once again, you try to compare sunsetting social security and Medicare, to freezing increases
Since communist Marsha is so close with China’s leadership, I’m surprises you didn’t go.
Hunter is a private citizen and you have no proof of wrongdoing.   Let’s investigate your daughter Mary and your son Chad.  Did you forget about that you were caught funneling $370,000 to “basement-run firms” owned by her daughter and son-in-law.
I kind of miss the balloon to be honest.
Blinker will do his job. Now can you stop tweeting and do yours?
You’ll never be happy. You should think seriously about changing careers.
Blinken shined his shoes
You know he apologized for shooting down the balloon!! This administration bows to the CCP!!
You don't know that he didn't !! You just like to complain,  even when you don't know what you're talking about.
Remember Susan McDougal? She served 18 months for ignoring a subpoena to testify against Bill and Hillary Clinton. — Repeat after me: Republicans made Susan McDougal serve 18 months in prison for defying a subpoena.
Marsha, I have far, far more confidence in Blinken's diplomatic abilities than yours. How about you just sit down and let the qualified pros do their work?
He doesn’t need your help.
Exhibit #179,895 demonstrating how Trump continues to be a nat’l  security threat. Foreigners visitors to Bedminster not background checked.

Well! Marsha. The answer is that Wang Yi's seven-year-old nephew made a balloon and accidentally floated into the United States.  CCP will not give you an answer, my answer will be more reasonable than CCP's.
Oh you smooth talking diplomat you.
This you?
#CPAC #GOP
How come the trump administration knew nothing about the three Chinese balloons that floated across the US during his time in office?
I’ll take Blinken standing up up for America every day over Boozy Blackburn.
Blinken was on a goodwill mission.
You don't even do your own job. Why are you telling others how to do theirs? 
Go back to beauty college!
He was collecting commission for doing nothing until too late for the balloons.

How do you know he didn’t demand an answer Marsha?  What a drama queen.
Yep, Blinken should have done a lot of things. What did you actually do? What action have you taken to change anything? Crying on twitter doesn’t count as action.
They did weeks ago.
How do you know he didn't?
I think Blinken already knows why they were in our air space to be honest
Not your concern You are a minor player on the diplomatic stage No wait ! You’re nothing on the diplomatic stage
Demanding an answer is part of a discussion, even if it's the first thing said. (Assuming an answer is wanted.)  Does that blow your mind?
Marsha Blackburn, you do realize Fox News used you for strictly entertainment purposes.   You supplied Fox with word salads, useless information and a comedic presence. Your ability to lie was your most favorable asset.
We are demanding that you politicians come clean of your deception to the Americans!
OK, Marsha 
Trump should have asked about the 3 they know when he was was playing president
Maybe he did. You weren’t invited.
Right ,and then he should have explained why we do the same thing over China mainland...
and how do you know he didnt ask?  Pretty presumptious of you to think he has to report back to you immediately  There is a pecking order and you are at the bottom of the list so cool your jets and stop gaslighting  Get an education fro christ sake!!!!!!!!!!
Sure, that's how diplomats act.  Before doing anything else, they make rigid demands of the other side.
Hire do you now he didn’t?
NO we need to demand an answer from our fascist leader as to why HE allowed and watched as it trekked across the USA- he knows why it was here..
 There’s most likely multiple reasons (spread conspiracy theories, lie, use fear mongering to name a few). preventing you from access ing critical information.
Apparently that’s one of the reasons the USA doesn’t want you to talk to other countries
Well, guess we’re lucky you’re not part of our diplomatic corps.  Don’t you have legislation for Americans to work on?  Or have you all just given up on any pretense of honoring your oaths of office?
Blah blah
I think that I can speak for all of us when I say we are all really, really grateful you are not in charge of the State Department.
How do you know he didn't?
Hmmm.   You didn't tell him to? Do you think there is a reason you were not in the room?
what did Trump do for the United States when he was President, other than rob it blind?
He may have.  If you was ambassador to China then you would have been invited.
Marsha must be hitting the Bottle early today
Do you trust blinkin I sure don't
How do you know what he talked about?
Justice for tyler canaris
How do you know he didn't?
Bend Over
Blinken is as weak as biden
Resign.
Back seat driver suggestion.
Senator Blackbun unless you have a better concept of how to effectively handle foreign procedures shut up
How would you know what was said?
Why does our senators not address this 
Jesus says you are a liar.
Why don’t you go over and demand something.
You should brush your hair.
Real diplomats already know the questions before they're even asked. Diplomacy is getting the answers. Blackburn: you're not qualified to even talk.
There are so many conspiracy theories about the balloon incident that it's easy to see how someone is maliciously creating a divide between the US and China
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, I think Ambassador Blinken knows his job far better than you do. You keep worrying about that farmland that you fantasize about!
How do you know he didn't?
And how do you know he didn’t? You just live to spread hate and division
I think I’ll trust the secretary’s judgment on this one, rather than taking the word of some rube from Tennessee.
Nazi #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica
Do you ever do anything other than run your mouth on FOX and post garbage on Twitter ??? The people of Tennessee deserve a dedicated representative!! That’s not you!!! #racist #TraitorsSupportTraitorTrump
Maybe he did, why would he tell you?
Marsha, we all know you don't have a job, but blinken is very accomplished at his. Maybe it is time for you to find something you're qualified for.
Republicans are in disarray.
Remember when the talk was that Russia put a bounty on our Military with al qaeda? Here's how TRUMP handled it.
You don't  know what they talked about.
FATWO
Didn’t you call Xi Marsha to ask him. What was his response.
Possibly partners that got caught in the public eye.
He won't and I doubt he will discuss it with them either
Oh... you were there to know what they did and didn't talk about?   Or are you just guessing and bearing false witness hoping to gaslight your base?
Fix the immigration laws.
Tony Blinken no doubt did demand to know this.
Help the J6 prisoners of war!!!!
Maybe you can channel this energy into some cupcakes. DM me for address. 
I thought talking about "Wangs" was against your Christian values?
Blackburn ought to fly over to China on a balloon - let the helium out - then descend into China while demanding China apologize for spying
TRUMP lied about the Russian Bounty Claimed he didn't get the briefing Claimed he just didn't read it Claimed Bush's said it was "fake' news  HE LIED 3 TIMES  TRUMP refused to talk to Putin about that Bounty? Our military should have come 1st before Putin
The meeting went like this. Please, Please don't fly any more balloons over the USA. It's making the administration look bad. Please. 
Impeach him!
You should prolly limit your foreign relations attempts to taking care of Tennessee Marsha.
How do you know what was said?
Ma'am, with all due respect, one does not 'demand' anything from an entity to which you owe billions of dollars, who has a military on par with yours if not superior to it, and who holds your top leadership in the palm of their hand.
These your people?
Stop worrying about Blinken and do your job.
How do you know he didn’?
Here is the State Department readout
Remember when TRUMP met with Putin in Helsinki? Remember how he sided with Putin against our own intelligence?   Then he refused to talk to Putin about the Bounty on our Military.  Somebody explain that to Marsha Blackburn.
Let me guess you have stock or get kickbacks from harm dealers? There is no other way to describe your wanting or needing another war you need that to fill your kickback fund!
You're not the Secretary of State!  Stay in your lane, traitor!
Thankfully we have experienced adults in charge of US foreign relations, because we know the GOP would really screw it up.
Fix your own state, welfare queen.
Stay out of it. Republicans voted AGAINST America and for China when they voted against the CHIPS Act. China owns many Republicans especially Senator Johnson. Vote all Republicans out of office in 2024.
Probably how your constituents feel about you not answering their questions in any town halls… for six years.
Seek professional help, Marsha.  
We have Jimmy Carter You have Donald Trump
Do U know that he didn’t?
The defense department has a message for ya there grandma. “We got this” sit down and have some more to drink. Jesus has a message for ya drunky L’chaim!!!
WH doesn't want to do anything to provoke the Chinese so standing up to them and give them a piece of our minds is off the table!!!  Sleepy Joe's order before he took for ANOTHER long weekend to Delaware!
How do you know he didn’t? You don’t.
Because that's what they do. The real question is... why did our multi trillion dollar national defense allow it?
How do you know he didn't do that?
Tennesseans never see this kind of passion from Blackburn towards holding GOP crooks accountable on obstructing justice regarding the violent insurrection attack against Americans voting rights on January 6th or Fox News who promoted fraudulent lie that ripped our country apart!
The American First Reich is against Communism but supports Neo-Nazis in Ukraine. We've become the 'Bad Guys' we fought against in WWII.
Seditionist says what?
Oh you're just mad because you thought it was one of those bribe balloons coming your way!
Lookie Marsha demanding. Stay in your corrupt lane.
How do you know he didn’t?
Oh, Hagatha....do you honestly think they will tell you any REAL conversation? You are a traitor.
He was having trouble communicating as he was put in a corner facing the wall.
Your aren't an expert in diplomacy. Far from it.
He won’t ask because he already knows the answer. And he’e ok with it.
Even on TFG's failing site, no love for you. how sad.
Legislate   It's your job
I demand an answer as to why you haven’t had a town hall. and why you participated in an insurrection
Marsha, your yarn ball  is a mess. Shouldn’t you focus on it instead of things beyond your knitting basket?  Seriously! Stop!
How do you know what they discussed?
How do you know he didn’t- You make more  “assumptions “ than anyone on the platform~
You should help Tennesseans who have suffered from opioid makers, rather than taking $700,000 from them.
Please relax Marsha and cut some slack...thanks
How do u know he didn’t
Whew I feel better knowing today you are a wold leader. 
Remember when the Democrats and the news media demanded that Trump confront Putin. Then, how they wanted transcripts of their private conversations and how they wanted to know from Putin what Trump said? Will the demand same from Blinken’s meeting in China?
Except if they are spy balloons from China. https://t.co/q51QqmFn4U
We know that a range of entities operate objects at high altitudes for purposes that are not nefarious.    But make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down.

Why accept papers from WIV when there has not been an independent investigation of whether they killed millions? It looks like they did and you seem cool with that.

كلخرا ابن الكلب بتاع الاشاعات الوسخ
Oh, so the political right were quite happy for China to be flying a balloon around US airspace?  You're a clown. You'd do anything for attention. Even if it undermines &amp; contradicts the views of your own base.
Evidence of cheques being paid by the Chinese to Joe Biden?  Didn't think so. Lying piece of crap.
Mate, you don’t even know what you want to be yourself, how would you make decisions for the rest of the country. Fucking botch job.
Didn't narcissism control you enough already?
But spy balloons from China that invade our airspace for 8 solid days = Good to go!
China is now mocking Biden thst he shoots down a hobby club balloon but ignores an ecological catastrophe in Ohio.  I know it is CCP propaganda but it is spot on.
CCP wouldn't take DOD head Austin's call. That's not good. Not good at all
You're right. They tell it like it is while our media ignores it.
China mocks US over the spy balloon shooting but ignores the toxic plume over Ohio.  That’s rich coming from China, but shows how they view Biden’s weak Presidency.
Except for the balloons from China...
the continental U.S., the official said.  Balloons and other unidentified objects have been previously spotted over Guam, a strategic hub for the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the western Pacific.  It’s unclear how much control China retained over the balloon once it veered from its
US President should ask Chinese President Xi Xinping who hides from but sends spy balloons to the world over to stop this &amp; better fly kites in China's skies. https://t.co/NYj3YA3grm
Where do China's balloons come from? We tried to take a look - NBC News  #Trending #News #Headlines #TopStories  https://t.co/OGnhf40K62
This is the weirdest story. I wonder what’s really going on. Did we ever get the equipment from the China balloon or did we just ‘drop a pin’ so the Chinese can find it?
It baffles me that searchers can explore the Titanic in DEEP waters, yet our military divers can’t recover anything from a supposedly shot down foreign object in waters only 50 feet deep???
Exactly!
As usual, I don't believe what the Regime tells us
It was recovered yesterday.  We covered it in our Twitter Space from yesterday 4-5pm.
Ok, cool.
Diversion as usual.  Clowns running the circus
China's spy balloon flying over our country, the White House has 12 different types of people from lesbians to drag queens, it lies about the jab,all the lies about what's in it killing our elderly, or people we left in Iraq, to be hung by our own helicopters,worse president ever
Covid 19 boosters, great reset, lgbq, burning down all mom and pop shops, defunding the police, sending billions and billions of dollars to Ukraine, Biden things money is free, there's been three major world disasters since he took office, gas prices soaring, food on the rise
That's just scratching the fucking surface, where's biden's boy at with all that money, where's that laptop at still not clear, Biden is the big man but nobody will do shit about it, the president's letting China buy up all our land that we grow food on, and so much more,so much
Owning China by tactically engaging every single balloon that floats away from a child's birthday party
Accepting &amp; praising papers from WIV is like accepting Chinese reports that their downed spy balloon was a weather balloon. China is West's biggest existential threat! Forget about Putin's flagging army. The PLA has HLA ethnic-restricted Ebola &amp; MERS mice! Gullible westerners!🤬

Only the “Land of the brave” who masked 2 year old babies, believing they posed a threat to your safety! Could get invaded by giant balloons from China!
so China sends surveillance balloons over the U.S. and suddenly they have 3 cases of toxic chemicals flooding into the air? either it’s a distraction tactic from the U.S. to cover up the balloons or China has unleashed some kind of biochemical warfare. be prepared.
Yes we saw many photo's of the China balloon. Nothing on the harmless ones that we were not in danger from. That had to be shot down with all fury. Could not let them travel into our airspace.
Great Q from as these objects are indeed benign as  asserts then let’s release the jet ATFLIR and Gunsight video feed. Why the silly secrecy over a ‘boy scout or weather balloon’?
Trying to recover from the China balloon fiasco!

I'd like to apologize for a post before and comments on other posts about the weather balloon from China. It was a weather balloon from China not the same thing as Anita like NASA had done in the Antarctic. https://t.co/jaaQmHYGo1
I pressed White House's John Kirby on claim, without evidence, of Chinese Spy Balloons under WATCH and REACT. https://t.co/V1pPLTo20a
Lol a Meme…
Excellent!
Great question.  To bad Kirby never answered it.
'Uh, uh, uh it's a uh, uh'   They're lying.
This answer is exactly what I expected
Keep calling them out! 
They said the balloons were undetected so then how do they know it happened? They are lying
I know this is hard to understand for simple brains, but if you listen hard, he explained that.
Keep it up Simon!  They HATE taking questions from you, because you are not a stooge for the mainstream media, but ask hard, probing questions.
John Kirby lies daily. I don’t say that lately.  I don’t like bearing false witness against my brother.  this guy absolutely lies daily.
A lot of people lie daily. Especially in government. The previous administration lied daily too.
Bravo.
Right on, Simon.
Thanks Simon. Good reporting as usual.
Kirby's halting speech was him trying to figure out how best to word the 'no answer - answer' he was planning to provide.  Keep asking direct questions Simon - make them work to lie to us!!
Yes!!! He called on you! And fantastic question!
This is what “lying on the fly” looks like folks
Lying by the seat of your burning pants  is what it’s called….
the government is corrupt
The slowness in his response is due to him trying to remember which lie is which.
Last time I checked, the Military is the Military.  Who is he referring to when he says “we” performed forensics?
Great job Simon thank you 
Blah blah blah, luv you Simon 
They did a forensic audit on Chinese spy balloons when they came into office 
These people don't expect anyone to question the bullshit they keep spreading. No one, not a hardcore koolaid drinker, believes they had embarrassing info on Trump, but didn't use it before they needed to distract from their balloon debacle.
You doing the job that the US media suppose to do, unbelievable.
Good questions and comments Simon!!!
Can tell easily he is lying…
He's like a used car salesman.  unbelievable.  Great question Simon!!    #BidenShouldResign #HarrisShouldResign #MayorkasShouldResign #KirbyShouldResign #MilleyShouldResign #AustinShouldResign #JailBidenCrimeFamily
Kirby is lying thru his teeth. The whole administration is serial liars.
Lies and more lies
He ignored your proper delivered messanot accepting #African #Journalist. Keep pressing him. His answer was poorly delivered and do not buy the excuses given. US has balloons, satellites and high altitude aircraft thst China does not possess. Keep up the good work Simon
Well done Mr. Ateba!!
Good for you, Simon! Standing up for yourself and calling out how you have been treated by this administration. Great question today.
Looks like he was trying to think real hard on what lie is was going to say. Good job on asking the hard question.
Love the first question, and your integrity in shaming the liar openly in the room. Sadly, this might be the last time that he calls on you friend. Stellar work and a follow for sure.
Liar!!!
Great job 
Great question!
Kirby’s nose is growing again.
More lies ..
Yeah he didn’t answer your question, just threw out a bunch of word salad
OMG.  He cannot answer you to save his life.
Treason!!!!
Glad to see they called on you!
Anything 'Anti-Trump' was intentionally leaked out of the highest levels of government, fed to the mainstream media like a shark feeding. THREE violations of American sovereignty by China, as Trump built the wall WOULD have been MAJOR, and publicized. Didn't happen.
There were "brief incursions" of spy balloons in the Trump administration. Okay. I guess they realized that claiming major incursions (like flying over the entire US) would be a lie too far, even for their media shills.
I’m so happy you were able to finally ask a question 
He’s still lying
The current administration has zero credibility &amp; has had zero accountability for the lies, spread out in layers from the very beginning of the Trump campaign. Hindsight is 20/20-leaving not only the American people, but also the people of the world in a state of utter distrust.
Translation - I am struggling to make sh*t up this time. So let me reach into my rectal orifice.
You can tell when he is lying, he looks down.
What question I would like to know is why spy balloons? They have 100's of satellites, spy planes, tik tok, and thousands of different ways to gather info about us. Why would they send a balloon that everyone can see to spy on us. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of spying??
Keep grinding Simon! Make Kirby lie on record over &amp; over again.
He’s still lying!
Great question, btw.
A military officer reached out to me tonight: “Biden’s speech on the balloons was all lies”
Good for you sir
Good for you!
Way to get it on record, Simon on how your questions have been ignored by and the - and by the way - to have you detained by the Secret Service and not allowed into the Biden press briefing- highly disturbing!
I believe as well that the present administration is lying through their teeth about incursions under Trump.  Thank you for your stand for Truth, Mr. Ateba.
You’re awesome Simon!!
Nice. Well done Simon! Kirby never actually answered the question.
Thank you Simon. Light shed amongst the darkness to reveal truth! 
So no Simon we will not be giving any evidence at all.
So happy for you Simon, you were finally called upon to ask a question.
Keep it up Simon! Make these people accountable
Great  job.  Of  course  Kirby  does  not  really  answer  the  question.  But  keep  going  after  them  Simon.
They couldn’t identify the hobby balloon as a hobby balloon in real time, so why would we believe their forensic analysis?
excellent question!! Fun to watch Kirby squirm 
Keep it up Simon!!!
Thank you Simon for your boldness and bravery in asking simple, straight-forward questions on behalf of all concerned citizens.  I applaud your persistence and your calm demeanor...
Yes, let's protect classified information, by keeping it in a storage locker with a car....
It is almost like he learned from Kamala about how to use a bunch of words, to say NOTHING, and avoiding a direct answer, when he talks to the media. 
So glad someone finally called on you! Guess they can claim anything is classified and not have to answer
This is always about what this administration can use or do to say “But Trump”. It’s pathetic and weak. Keep pushing Simon.
My question would be “You stated “brief incursions” during Trump. Can you define “brief incursions” in this case, versus crossing the mainland US and hovering over key military installations?
Congrats on continuing to press daily and finally getting a question!
That’s a cute story he told you.
BRAVO!!
You’re one of the few that actually asks real questions.. that’s why they don’t like you.  I’d wear it as a badge of honor.
Thank you, Simon. I appreciate your tenacity.
How could anyone doubt the veracity of John Kirby?
He didn't answer your question at all.
Great job Simon. Hope to see you called on regularly.
Outstanding Simon!
He sounds like Joe Pesci in My Cousin Vinny his first time in court
You are a brave man Simon-thank you!  First of all, his answer sounds like B.S.  Secondly, a “brief incursion into US airspace “ doesn’t sound like it made it over the mainland.  All smoke and mirrors smeared with B.S.
Still need evidence of all incursions, regardless of timing.
So they know what happened 3 years ago but don’t know what they themselves shot down 3 days ago?  Hmmmm.
Dates and pictures…. Proof please.
Price less
Simon has no fear, great journalist!
But if Trump’s admin didn’t know about the balloons, how was it recorded for Biden’s admin to find, and also why wouldn’t the Dems on the Intel committee leak it to the press?
Nice! Glad u finally got to ask a question. I’m sorry he didn’t answer it. This has been the least transparent administration in our history. Keep up the good work!
You should ask him why they are shooting down $12 weather balloon science projects from kids if they are so good at knowing what's in the skies.
Liar! Liar! Pants on Fire!  - I wish, every time you lied to the American public.
Oh it’s “classified”… give me a break.
Awesome job! Thank you for asking the questions we want answers too. We know what kind of answers we are going to hear… a bunch of words. Did we really get an answer? No… but at least you were willing &amp; were finally allowed to ask. Thank you!
The repeated emphasis on "brief" makes me think they were ridiculously short-lived - to the point where giving the duration would make it laughable.
Good job!
He could not think up his lies fast enough to answer your question.  Show us the proof! All you get from this WH is lie after lie.  Same old answer it's classified.
Excellent question!
Thank you Simon. He lies about lying.
But the rambler said it’s not spy balloons the other day so which is it ?
What a lame response!  Typical.....
Looking forward to your next question in the summer. 
So we now know that three spy balloons incursions happened under Trump but nobody knew about it back then.  That's all that needs to be said.
He never answered your question
He  lied again. So funny.
Kirby is a liar
Yep.. he’s a liar
Liar 
Most if not all video of the balloon came from average folks! No such recordings from the so called acts under Trump
"after doing forensics, we learned that it had happened during the trump years" (para)  uh dude, he said it BEFORE they recovered the balloon.
Liar.
It's classified. Just believe us.
Great question. Thank you for having the balls to ask it.
Kirby’s specialty is skirting around the edges, I never expected a straight answer. But kudos Simon for asking, real journalists like you are an endangered species these days.
Much respect to you Simon keep up the great work 
You sir are based. Great job.
Sounds like John was doing a fancy tap dance - and was having a hard time "justifying" his lie live....Good Q, Simon!  Thank you for laying it out - flat and blunt - no wiggle room for JKirby!
Great question Simon! Kirby really squirmed his way through that one!
Thanks for asking the real questions that no one else asks.
Refreshing to hear an actual journalist in action.
This "capability" of surveillance balloons is not New!  Our Military &amp; NORAD have been surveiling our skies for these since WWII.  A balloon "briefly in US airspace" meaning w/in 12 nautical miles of shore, would have been monitored &amp; shot down if it came near land!!
He has no evidence. He provides no evidence. He plays the word game. Next time ask him how many balloons were discovered from Obama era? It's disgusting the way they play politics. NSA,DNI said it didn't happen.
More spin and avoidance…thank you for asking the correct questions and being a true patriot.  You are a star 
No evidence
If it’s classified why are you talking about it. Another leftist lie meant to discredit the last president. Hard to believe he’s in a position or power.
He didn't say all three were from Trump's administration and he did say "briefly" entered air space.
Thank you for asking the right Q's!  He never answered it though! Gaslighting as usual from the WH!
Why don't you press him on the US gov blowing up the pipeline.
Well said, Simon Ateba!
Finally!  Good job.
You're my idol
Love your effort and questions!  Keep it up!
Keep up the great work, Simon
Thanks for asking the tougher questions
Good job sir. Keep it up.
Great question, no answer!
He’s still not being honest
Long pause...that would be a yes.
Reasonable answer
Well done!! Keep up your great work!
One of his better performances
Answers the question about if he's lying by lying.  Guess we can take that as a yes.
Well done, sir. Fair question.
You're really valuable, Simon, and becoming more difficult for them to ignore.
  Ask Him Or Them About This Next Time.  Pentagon testing surveillance balloons across the Midwest
Why did you wait until it passed completely over the US to take it down? So, no one told the Trump administration about the incursions and you are now studying them? I smell a whopper!
Simon, I was not a fan before but now I am.
hes worthless
Lies lies lies. Thank you Simon
Again you are hands down the best in that room.
So he doesn’t have any images or proof to what he is saying and didn’t answer the gentleman’s question.
I don't buy it at all.  1. I watch Alex Jones and he's been talking about these balloons for a while.  2. If it did happen under, Trump 3 times. Why didn't they scope these balloons out then?  3. I hear the military didn't even tell the Trump admin. it even happened, Why?
He became a political hack
Congrats on the question Too bad it wasn’t answered.
Ateba: "Are you lying to the American people?" Kirby: "Let's not miss the forest through the trees here."
Long winded w/o detail.  Typical political crap.
YOU are their worst nightmare; an ACTUAL African man, who sees through ALL their bullshit...and lets them know in front of the whole world! I love you man!
 Simon this the FIRST AND ONLY time that Kirby has answered a question with some respect! Respect shown to the question and the person who asked it. Well done!
It was Russia Russia Russia and now it's China China China.....unethical commies
Good job, Simon!
Good question! His tune changed quickly. More of the press needs honest questions like this
As usual, it's the White House talking in circles, and not actually answering the question asked.
Define "brief incursion".  Does he consider traveling from AK to NC to be a "brief incursion"?
Forensics before the balloon was shot down &amp; recovered? They had “unknown” spy balloon incursions under the previous admin (Trump) but now they are known? Spin &amp; Lies. Kirby cant look up as he spins his lies.
I will state this emphatically...if ANY foreign balloon ever flew in USA airspace during the Trump admin. President Trump would have blown it sky high and it would not have taken 3 days for him to act!
Simon Ateba
I’m betting the 3 “incursions” he’s talking about were balloons from a birthday party
Ironic how in "systemically racist" USA the white guy took the black journalists question and the black, lesbian immigrant refuses to talk to Simon. Kirby is clearly not used to answering direct, honest questions.
What a beast!!!!!!  like a boss
W*nker
Why all those hesitations in speech? Because he's a bald faced liar. Happy you finally got a question. 
Who are the Trump admin officials? My bet is left over deep state actors.
The US should get together with all allies and discuss China’s aggression. China needs us and we need China at this point but their aggression and determination to take over has to be addressed!!
Rock star..journalism. The way it should be with everyone across the board
Good job Simeon
He said nothing
Lol, you are an unserious tool. No wonder people don’t call on you.
Lies lies and more lies.
I think the WH is lying about all of this.  I have ZERO trust in any of the government agencies.
Simon is awesome
Kirby is a liar and everyone knows it!!
Yes, Simon, I'm  lying as usual!
Keep asking those tough questions Simon.....kudos to you.
So he's saying there were three balloons during the Trump administration but no one in the United States  saw one of these balloons. Mark my words if there was something going on during the Trump administration CNN would had broadcast at 24/7
Kirby is lying to you. His body language is screaming lie.
Lying big time
Let's never mind the fact that five eyes is still active.  The Chinese have every legal jurisdiction to fly a spy balloon over.  But let's talk about the facts was it a high school education project?  Weather balloons have been active in sold on the open market for years...
I'm wondering if the prior incursions during Trump's administration are only "classified" because no one saw them? People across the country saw this one and recorded it.
If this was true, Pelosi, schifft and Schumer would have been screaming this at the top of their lungs when Trump was in office. They would have used this to impeach him a 3rd time and would of said it was enough evidence to arrest him and take him down. But they said nothing.
Thankyou, Simon for asking real questions! As usual this guy Kirby spouts bull! Hopefully, you won't have to wait 6 months again, because as an American, I really appreciate you doing real journalism!
Blinken says China offered 'no apology' for surveillance balloon  One of the weakest admins in US history expected an apology from the CCP? lmaoo  https://t.co/MRnsKFNbiu
It is not just being weak (all Dem administrations at least after Truman have been weak on national security - and that is why they have been favored by the rivals of this country over Republicans). Biden and his cohort have been hostages of CCP due to "Big Guys'" 10% cut.
Believing the massive superpower you live in is constantly being invaded by balloons from China is a coping mechanism to distract from increasing nationalism.
The term “Chinese spy balloon” is fine because the balloon came from China with a specific, malicious goal and was acting on behalf of the Chinese government.  The term “Chinese virus” was just an excuse used by some to harass random Asian people.   Very different.
Great Lib explanation that makes zero sense 
Which part of it makes no sense?
The last part.
Or it originated there.. simp..
Korbo wont get it, hard to see anything under a KKK hood
Viruses have been named for the Origin for more than 150 years.
not true
How about we call it the Fauci virus
Why don’t some people understand that?  Almost like they want to be racists. 
But we can call rubella German measles because that's where it was found just like the Wuhan virus was started in Wuhan
Really?
I never thought it was a “Chinese spy balloon” I personally think that this is exactly like what happened with Roswell in 1947. I think they shot down some alien spacecraft but just calling it a Chinese spy balloon just like back in 1947!
What's the difference? No, seriously. I would like you to explain the difference that explains why we can't describe two things that came from the same country using the same descriptor. I think your response will help a lot of the country understand. Go.
Half true Chinese virus is used because it comes from " CHINA" in my President Trump voice
It's actually a nasa balloon. Corona virus came from China. This was proven in congressional hearings. Maybe quit listening to the lying news media 
No, genius.  The virus was created and unleashed in China.
Harass Asian people? We were all waiting for a far left lunatic to throw in The Good Old Ace in the hole,when in doubt," The race card."That card doesn't work anymore, it burnt itself out. Try a new theme next time it might work instead
It wasnt used to harass chinese people, it was used to indicate it came from china. And not sugar coat it to protect the ccp
You do know that it is customary to name a virus after its place of origin right? There’s a specific reason why they didn’t want that because it would make China (CCP) look like an enemy. Which they are either way.
Exactly the virus comes from China with a possibly "malicious" intent? By? CCP or hmm? Of the mutated genetically engineered Frankenstein gain in function research funded virus.?
Your first paragraph could be used to perfectly describe the wuhan virus. You don’t have the evidence you think you do to prove otherwise.
Hahaha! A term to harass Asians? Wow, you Leftists really are deluded
The china virus was maliciously engineered by China and funded by Fauci. Its spread politically benefited the Democratic party. These are truths.
Um.... What you described for the balloon actually applies to the virus. Are you really that bent on making yourself look foolish?
No it wasn't. We was told the virus started from Wuhan, which I believe is in China, so Chinese virus is the truth and not a racist slur.....unless we haven't been told the truth all along ??
After all the factual findings that prove China crafted that virus, you think that thos is all am excuse to "harass Asian people"....? If this is the US' future, them the mighty shall fall.
Um, your description of the balloon matches the reality of the virus.
No, it is not to harass Asian people… China deliberately made the virus in a lab and spread it all over the world
You're a moron. Tons of evidence that covid 19 was made in a lab in China. Aka China virus.
Only a brainwashed fool would not see that both are equal except for propaganda from the government controlled media.
Very different and very obvious yet Sorbs and his Christian values are absolutely clueless
What  you people are fucking nuts
How ignorant
The virus came from China, you nit-wit.
Everyone needs to pay attention to this.  I am appalled that the Gov of SD was NOT informed by the White House about the balloon from China. Please listen!
In the last few weeks, we’ve learned quite a bit about Biden admin’s China policy. Most importantly, they lament that the spy balloon incident derailed Blinken’s visit to Beijing, and they’re already trying to reschedule. Diplomacy no matter what. Stark contrast from Trump admin.
Given it's now established the balloon was merely "diverted on errant path caused by atypical weather conditions" (dixit WaPo: https://t.co/ySETBmIsqe), how can China ensure it "never happens again"? Control the weather? This administration is utterly irrational.
That was the DODs defense for letting it cross the entire US. They claimed they jammed communications so it couldn't transmit data to China all the while having U2s and other assets film the payload and intercept communications.
Thanks, I hadn't caught that!
China has fighter jets. They surely can intercept its own rogue balloon if it deviates from a planned flight path. China could also require installation of devices to deflate a balloon if it deviates. But all of that would be valid only if the balloon was actually a civilian one.
How rational is it to send a fighter jet to shoot down your own wayward balloons everytime they get blown away by the wind just to satisfy the paranoiac delusions of an adversary?
Make a phone call?
He said the incursion must not happen again, not that they should receive a warning if it does
It was the lack of a warning (and clear communication about what it was) that made it an incursion.
How do you know there were no warning? And just to be clear: your definition of an incursion is that if you warn about it before, it's not an incursion? Interesting 
First, the Chinese government hasn’t claimed they gave a warning. Second, I’m saying that if, among other things, the Chinese government had informed the US in advance that a balloon had gone adrift and would soon fly over the US, I wouldn’t consider it an incursion.
Condemnation, stressing, warnings, then finishing with a turn to "the importance of keeping open lines of communication".  Aggression, aggression, aggression, then pretend they're the reasonable ones.  US diplomacy in a nutshell.
Yes, very worrying
people are laughing at picoballoons being shot down, the reality just scares me
Blinken prend le public américain pour des cons.
Blinkie is just a poser posing. We'll never know what was really said, I'll wait for the Chinese readout.
He 'warned' an Independent nation from providing what he calls 'material support' to another independent nation that it shares a boarder with.
It is notable how consistently Blinkered's interactions with foreign diplomats consist of him "telling" them things and "warning" them.  Is it that none of them are able to "speak" - or just that Blinkered lacks the ability to "hear"?
Who does Blinken think he is? How dare he?
Or US always has been full of Nazis..
Russia is gonna lose.  Deal with it, pal.
The balloon succeeded beyond everyone’s wildest dreams. Oscillate while the sun still shines.
They both know what they are talking about. You do not know.   Therefore, do not go where you do not understand anything.   Write about medicine  But for some reason you are only interested in politics in which you do not understand anything.
There appears to be 2 governments in the US. Both saying different things.
They are acting rational, if the objective is conflict, though 
Hope they warned the US about material support for Ukraine as it could end in a nuclear war.
This was obvious from the very beginning. The temperature in the northeast dropped 50 degrees in less than a day. It was obvious that the jet stream took a brutal plunge south and dragged everything along with it.
dead duck beak hard 
This is the guy who was part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline terrorist attack trying to lecture other countries. The nerve of this scumbag.
I pity foreign diplomats who have to deal with our guy who is completely devoid of good faith, has no desire for détente and just wants to wag his finger
Kurt Metzger, American comedian, has dubbed this all Balloonary 6th.
Do you think only this administration is irrational? 
Could Wang Yi have taken anything from that conversation beyond "Blinken is a moron" and "the USA is nuts"?
Biden likes to sound all big.. That's about all he has.. An act..
Excuse him for his brain got stuck in his bottom.
And YOUR government wants YOU to believe that silly homemade "spy balloon" came from China?😂🤣 China’s FAST Telescope about the size of 30 standard football fields. It can detect signals from as far as 13.7 billion light years away, almost the edge of the universe. https://t.co/syVWy3Zgfv
Ya but its limited by the earths movement. It cant point to earth 
Our gov. expects an apology from China regarding their spy balloons? If they did apologize, it would mean nothing to them. That’s not going to stop the CCP’s effort to conquer the USA! What you can do is start kicking their firms/ businesses out of the US! https://t.co/7LeYaY7cJT
The party of manpons
Walmart is really Chyna Inc with an Arkansas brand name
Yankee go home 
is an embarrassment
exactly and stop their food products from poisoning our kids!
It’s so beyond an apology, this is just propaganda
This guy should not be spearheading anything, he should be ousted and immediately replaced by somebody competent
I have to ask the question - we're talking balloons, not blimps or dirigibles - do they have any kind of guidance? They pretty much go where ever the wind blows them - yes?
Our gov. is dependent on Chinese money, technology, manufacturing and bribes. Joe and Hunter became multimillionaires because of China. They have no intention of stopping any of this. Pure propaganda.
They're here we're there. It's business no matter how shady. It's all about the money.
er can stop buying them or watch ANYTHING BY THEM. WE DO HAVE A CHOICE . do not accept their crap.
Peace through Strength, no respect for the weak
Why should they joe is weak
Lol, He’s fake just like Brandon ! CCP is laughing
We aren't sorry for blowing up their balloons or their satellites. They trespassed!
Is he serious
Agree
Agreed kick them out of the United States
Either these people are incredibly naïve or they are intentionally selling out to China. I fully suspect the latter.
What'd they expect Chinese food for life?  Fortune cookies that say you are a Donkeys behind Jackass
Are there any adults in this administration. #IMPEACHBIDENNOW
Thanks for restoring my happiness in my darkest days, during those period I invested $500 and to my greatest surprise I got a return of $14,200 in just seven days her reliability can't be equated
These people are idiots… and we will be in a war because of them!!!
. china virus or china balloon theres no differance , they came from the same location https://t.co/mGtGb3SVey
You couldn’t stop the flow of a spy balloon into the USA.  I highly doubt you have the ability to halt the flow of fentanyl precursors from COMMUNIST CHINA into Mexico than you can stop the flow of fentanyl from the Mexican cartels to our kids and young adults… COME ON MAN.…

For 6 days, President Joe Biden allowed a surveillance balloon from China to violate our airspace and fly across the United States. None of the "excuses" given for his dereliction of duty, and failure as Commander in Chief, are reasonable. In fact, they make no sense whatsoever. https://t.co/iISubw6f5b
Yes, but they shot down a couple of hobbie weather balloons so all is good now.
Biden is compromised by CCP.  It all makes absolute sense.
Ask yourself what military bases lie underneath that flight path. And what's happening right now at those bases.
Because he’s a treasonous paid-for whore.
Trump didn’t even know about the balloons under his watch , ignorance , denial delusions deflection projection hypocrisy contradiction irony, well done YOU
In my view the so called deep state is actually Ccp infiltrated Evil power in US, when US make the decision to defeat Ccp, the deep state gonna be eliminated. Now both the House and Senate defined the spy balloon from China as invasion,good start for defining unrestricted war
Apologies! From China? A humble meteorological helium balloon? You’ve got to be kidding…..
China should present a 20 pages long apology, have it read out aloud s l o w l y in Mandarin, with subsequent translation into 24 different languages, with English being the very last. Let the American delegation s t a n d and listen for 6+ hours.
Well, you know: "The closer the collapse of an Empire, the crazier its laws... [...its political leaders, its rules, its demands, its logic, its public statements and its wars]."  - Marcus Tullius Cicero [with slight additions, sorry Cicero!]
Unfortunately he isn't.  He is one of the greatest liars on the world stage and is probably the worst diplomat in the history of the world.
This is the mentality of a thuggish declining empire at it end stage of decline.
And spy ballons too https://t.co/zN9RijNKZS
Just met with the PRC’s top diplomat, Wang Yi. I condemned the incursion of the PRC surveillance balloon and stressed it must never happen again. I warned China against providing materiel support to Russia. I also emphasized the importance of keeping open lines of communication.
You ALLOWED the incursion of the spy balloon. You let it collect classified information over nuclear military sights all over the US. You endangered America and made us a global laughing stock.   NOW you're "condemning" the incursion.   How embarrassing.
And what was his reply?
Most likely this....
United States, Israel and Brazil were countries that did  not recognized Maduro as President of Venezuela. I said were, because since January, 1st, when Lula became President of Brasil, Brazil shift its position and passed to recognize Maduro as President of Venezuela.
Lula is on the Ukraine blacklist.
China is immediately insulting you.   “Wang Yi made clear China's stern position on the so-called ballon incident and demanded that the U.S. side change course and face up to and address the damage caused to U.S.-China relations by the abuse of force.”
US,A lying secretary of state
With all due respect, you and need to hurry up and get Ukraine everything they need to win now so China doesn't have time to get more involved.
Thank you for standing up against China. Hopefully your message was heard. Hard to keep the channels open when one side is supporting Russia in its crimes against humanity in Ukraine.
This is laughable. Standing up to China? 
Now what? Nothing? They will do it again because they know you’ll do nothing.
What do you want over a balloon to which they claimed you have flown at least 10x into their airspace? Try nuke each other next?
What did they say ?
I'm sure he was shaking in his shoes.
So far, the US has not been able to provide evidence to prove that it is a "spy" balloon.   You should apologize to China instead of shirk your responsibility and frame China.
No engagement  No negotiation  No compromise   Three nos policy  Life lessons learned from struggle with CCP by Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo
can you please get my roblox account unbanned
You are a National shame and embarrassment. Resign in shame for a role you were never qualified for and maybe the world might start to return to peace we had under President Trump.
Brazen Imperialist.   ‘warnings’ to an emerging superpower, , are weak and hollow.  Use them sparingly, because we all now know your bark is worse than your bite
Good  One. Now that’s what I call America First policy. Well done.
what was his response?
Lemme guess.  This was his reaction, right….
But Biden said the balloon is not for military surveillance. It could be likely commercial. What’s going on with this administration?
You really think they feared anything YOU said??? You and your president are both weak and cowardice.  Others see it, what was once the leading strongest country in the world has become a laughing stock of weak mean
In other words you picked up a check from #China. . .
They probably shuddered?
So US and all over NATO can send lethal aid to Ukraine but china can’t help Russia… hypocrisy at its best
So you groveled.  Got it.   You are an embarrassment
This is a Satire account right?
But what did they say to you?   Did they agree to give the if the gives them   Seems like the type of quid pro quo (I mean conspiracy theory) the Democrats love.
US Secretary of State... always seeking conflict. Hope you get what's coming to you Blinken.
Oh wow! Such a stern rebuke! I’m sure they’re shaking in their boots.
Sure they scared
Sounds like nice and relaxing chat then.
Thank you, dear , for helping defeat #TerroristRussia by cutting off its lines of support from #China ! Ukraine must win!
You can't warn China tbh
I dunno champ, I don’t think they’ll listen
Now speak with AMLO for his callous neutrality
Condemned, stressed, warned, emphasized.  Hmm...don't know that will hit they way you hoped.
I'm sure you were read into the statement #WangYi said of the U.S. - US reaction to balloon ‘absurd and hysterical’, says top Chinese diplomat. I hope you reminded him of this.
制裁中国政府的效果没有制裁中国官员及家属的效果好
And… What did they have to say to that? Sounds like it fell on def ears.
We must identify the relationships that bind us and set aside negative assumptions
Hilarious! I'm sure Wang Yi was shaken by that. 
Ukraine must win!
Amid Taiwan &amp; balloon, if level minister refused talk each other (Pentagon say Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe declined to on the line), at last some person in DC &amp; Beijing, still (keep) back channels open, in hopes of staving off disaster. #MSC2023
But you can provide to Ukraine &amp; Israel??
They probably all burst out laughing at you
China must be held accountable.
Seems like you said everything and wang yi listen you lime a school child...What a Joke...
Story for the gods
You didn't condemn anything! You bent over and asked for more!
I hope the Chinese foreign minister was very scared..
Blinky you are not the one in position of strengh.
I hope there were positive results. TY!
This doesn’t sound like the master of diplomacy I know.  Sounds more like a dress down than diplomacy.  China is just out of wolf warrior diplomacy and desperate for international recognition.  Do you expect this as a start of collaboration? Is there more to it?
Prepare Biden for a trade war with China.  A long trade war.
You sure it's wasn't an Indian Balloon so your trip to China gets cancelled ?  India has the most to lose if China and US work on getting the 99 cents store to be 99 cents again instead of the $1.29 it has become
We're certain general Milley is always open to a call! 
Two leading economies can achieve alot by working together.
Translation: I was tough to him but not to the point that he becomes offended and blocks me, still friends? 
"If you want to fly a spy balloon over us, just give me a call."
 this tweet is a direct opposite of what was actually said. Bet the chinese won't be happy after reading this but i totally blame them, what did they expect when they agreed to a meeting with a representative of an administration full of clowns and two faced liars.
He's probably still laughing
Anything on Covid origins or we going to just let that fly?
Too little. Too late.
Somehow I don't think they're afraid of Biden unfortunately
I am sure they will pick up the phones when top military brass call.....
Good!!!!
I can tell you were sub-standard in the honesty category. I saw your lips moving.
#GiveUkraineWings &amp; #GiveUkraineATACMS
Does anyone honestly believe that China takes the U.S. Military seriously?
Curious, what did he answered?
Doesn’t song like a happy meeting.
What spy balloons...you forgot you inadvertently shot it over the ocean and "lost" any evidence at sea...you provide weapons to Ukraine, weapons ...they provide dual use   goods .. see which one is much more problematic?
Can we also condemn using a $360,000,000 stealth warplane to pop a balloon?
Good boy. And what did he answer you?
Russia's aggression against democracy must be ended successfully as soon as possible, since a military confrontation with China is becoming ever more likely.  There is no sign that Xi Jinping wants anything else.
Like Hungary , they are doing deals for grain , for their people. China will always do what is best for its nation.
OMG!! Did he shiver?
Is there any transcript of you current lecture?  still remember the lecture in Anchorage
In reality what was said BB: Please sir don't make me look like a fool WY: That is your own choice BB: Please buy US debt and stop selling it WY: No BB: please adhere to Russian sanctions WY: No BB: We will talk shit on China after this meeting WY: Nothing new...
Sounds rather like a come to Jesus meeting. I hope he was listening.
Have a listenMr Blinken:
the last gasps of a dying empire
Clowns
US is the country that got defeated by taliban 
Pure unadulterated baloney from a very dishonest and dishonorable very low level Cabal agent.
Qui sont nos partenaires? Des soldats américains entraînent discrètement  les armées ougandaise, rwandaise, Kenyane et djiboutienne pour destabiliser la RDC.
What was his response?
And what did he say?
Can you just stop bargaining with them but do something useful?
Dude.  Speak reality.  And then get real yourself. 
All sticks, no carrots  Exceptional diplomacy.
"An informal contact with and  at the request of the U.S. " Wang Yi urged the U.S. to face up to and resolve the damage caused by the indiscriminate use of force to China-U.S. relations.
do you find that people often tune out when you start talking
Diplomacy should take priority over chastising our largest trading partner.
And you’re our top “diplomat”?  Do you even know what “diplomacy” means? 
Were they able to stop laughing about America scrambling fighters over balloons for a solid week?
Sy Hersh Says the U.S. Military Shot Down a Federally Funded Weather Balloon From the Univ. of Alaska  "That's what was shot down was one of those units that is sent up by the University but paid by the
China isn’t worried about the Biden regime and your he she its. You have made this country weak and the worlds joke.  Resign! You are a humiliation to this country
China’s top diplomat Wang Yi said the #US overreacted to the balloon incident. Shooting down a balloon for civilian use violates the international practice, which was hysteria. There are many balloons flying over the sky around the world, will the US shoot all of them down? #MSC
You are a representative of the most murderous and lawless state that has ever existed, where do you get off telling the countries you constantly spy on what to do?
You are an embarrassment to America and its diplomatic corps.
May I know who conducted the terrorist attack against the gas pipeline?
The world condemns the US’ global surveillance and destabilization programme and plead that it should end. The world also condemns the US for providing material support to Ukraine and prolonging the war. The world condemns the US’ influence operations.
Another giant waste of time. Why talk at all if you're just going to brag about belligerence on Twitter? Did that convo achieve anything?  Btw, it's impossible for China to provide "materiel" support to anyone. Learn to spell check..
You're a propagandist and a treasonous liar.
Just regurgitating the script from your employer lol
This public communication stands incomplete unless the U.S. Secretary of State tells the world what PRC top diplomat, Wang Yi, said in response.
I hope you received the response you deserve.
Can we call you Anthony Von Ribbentrop?
Am not sure, if this wise to share the discussion on this type of a platform…
"you warn" else what will you do? How arrogant are you to tell China what to do, when you are also providing Ukraine with weapons to achieve your geopolitical aim.
Думаю, он тебя послал.
Action please.
Are PRC trustworthy?
Awesome job you're doing all over the Globe Mr Blinken!
And then you reminded him that 10% go to the Big Guy.
What did Wang say to that
You kneel to CCP.
No country can stop  the Chinese support to Russia
... Warming...Warning...Warning!  Message delivery had failed. Please try again after the bark.
Another reason why people don't trust Government
Want want want want want
In this case, you have spoken in vain.  lines are confused.  do i hear?
Who are you after all to warn Chaina 
And Wang Yi said, oh ok sorry for all we will ?
Ok, now talk to Lavrov. When was the last time you spoke to him?
China is the next Russia. Any compromise is in vain.
Consider not renewing Chinese visas and green cards Mr Blinken.  Sending half a million Chinese back to Xi who love free speech &amp; Democracy would HELP the USA and spread democracy!!!!
I don’t think they care what you say at this point.  You guys are going to have to come up with a much better plan.  We are losing
Wow the most undiplomatic statement from a diplomat.  US new cowboy diplomacy, shoot first (balloon) ask question later
不要脸到极点，说的就是你吧
Excelente La libertad está presente  Gracias EEUU
Did u inform the Chinese counterpart about the NA1&amp;2 fuck up too that could have triggered WW3 and still might?
Let me ask you this Secretary do you think XI is really going to tell you if he was trading with Russia?
WARNED China?! are you sure?.
But said it was not China... They'll continue to provide to Russia as they are free as a country to do whatever they feel like ..how are you going to stop them? That's the issue.. sanctions are not working anymore... military confrontation? How many fronts can sustain?
If US didn’t blow up nord stream would you. E afraid of an investigation?
this is a crime Naked short selling can increase the manipulator's profit. A short seller, who profits by buying the shares to cover short position at lower prices than the selling prices, can drive the price of a stock lower by selling short larger numbers of shares
Their support to Russia seems more than materially.
yup.   you have to tell them off now and then..
Great! Ethic is Politics.
布哥，好棒棒。堅決抵制地心引力，絕不跪。

世界上的格局是在变化的。 如果不在有利时解决纳粹。 那么纳粹就会在全世界正义力量疲弱时开始扩张。 不如开战吧。
All good points. 
Very forceful and I’m sure they will comply.
各说各话，应不欢而散
Will china listen? There are reports china is indeed helping Russia in the war
Why all of a sudden is the USA spending hundreds of thousands of dollars shooting down weather balloons and hobby balloons that have been floating above most countries in large numbers for many years?
Did he laugh in your face? I would have
Why did you not beat him?
you trusted a  lier again
Shut up
oh, really？
So you made threats.  Not much of a leader are you?
Sure you did. 
Maybe you want to be more diplomatic in your tone. You sound like a whining child 
When are you going to get tanks, ATACMS and jets for Ukraine?
Your handing them our Country! And now pensions to Ukraine. What about Americans??? Please resign and take Pete with you. Why no peace talks with Russia and Ukraine????
What did they say? We ain’t scared.
So, Mr. Yi, top diplomat from China had to meet a visceral Warmonger from a bully country, what an unpleasant situation.
Release the audio tapes of the meeting or you're lying
Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and sale, with drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border — and impose strong penalties to crack down on trafficking.
Yes. Please take the time to focus on Chinese-synthesized fentanyl Mr President. Opioid deaths (driven by FENTANYL) exceeded 110,000 in 2022. #China #Mexico #fentanyl
IS THIS A JOKE?   CLOSE  THE  BORDER  (Until then, stop pretending to care…)
Fentanyl comes from china. So we should close the ports?
According to the dea cartels are the largest trafficking groups...through known trafficking corridors. That's a euphemism for the border.
Yes, Cartels are largely involved in trafficking drugs into the U.S. the same note also says the Chinese are mass producers of Fentanyl. So Cartels get the Powder from Ports. In Mexico but also heavily from U.S. Ports Due to our large trade commerce with China.
Post any link that backs up your absurd  claim. We'll wait for you.
Yeah... "cite your source, you election denying, threat to democracy, racist, bigot, white supremacist who can't think critically."
When you’re wrong result to name calling
You missed the point, entirely.  I was not calling you nor anyone, anything. You seem to lack the ability to comprehend sarcasm &amp; derision. My quotation marks should've been sufficient.
If you actually cared about this, you'd close the southern border.
It's not asylum seekers that are bringing in drugs, they usually come through legal ports of entry. "Closing the border" whatever that actually means would do nothing but harm people who are already incredibly vulnerable.
Uh hem
Do you know what a mule is? US citizens bringing drugs across the border. No where does this say this was from illegals
Why don’t you just shut up? If you truly cared about Americans you wouldn’t leave the borders wide open the way you and your administration have.
But they aren't open Brandon - Even the US Border Patrol has said that and everyone knows nobody actually wants to close the border to Mexico. It would completely kill off 70% of farming as people from Mexico often do that work since Americans won't. Abbott even hot mic'ed that.
People lining up to go through a drug detection machine?
I bet No vetting more diseases and crime
Biden's DEA Administrator says cartels in Mexico are smuggling fentanyl into the U.S. and “killing Americans with fentanyl at catastrophic and record rates.”  Cartels are taking advantage of Biden’s border crisis. We must secure the border.
Fentanyl ODs soared to 60,000 a year under Trump
This is true, however, I question the way people seem to be interpreting the data.
I got an idea
"BORDER."   What border???
Same border that trump had. Guess that wall was a waste of billions.
"Border" is more than a wall. Policy counts. Check the border stats. Listen to border patrol.  ...but you knew all that.
How about you start by CLOSING THE BORDER!
Agree
Then why did you build safe injection sites for drug users in San Francisco ?
Mr President, You want be the hero when your FAILURE Policies are the problem  Your OPEN Border Policy is NOT Helping
Mr President, You admit on your tweet that the problem is at our BORDERS and you the one keeping OUR BORDERS OPEN   
Since you made borders up and building injection sites doesn’t that make responsible for the deaths ?
How about we end the war on drugs? That would be a MUCH better solution.
You made this legal and promote this…
Maybe if you secured the border and told Democrats to stop legalizing drugs and enforce drug laws… things would be better?
Sincerely asking because I don’t know, but would it still be available for medical use? If not I hope we have something that will alleviate severe pain for everyone who needs it.
Close the border, Barry.
Because of you
Is this tweet 2 years old ? You kids missed the boat. 100 k dying a year.  Blood  on his hands
People regularly get drugs into prisons. So turning America into a prison still won’t stop drugs.  Let’s replace drug war with drug peace.
This is on you. Every death.
No it’s not he’s not making people put dope in their body laced with fentanyl but he’s not stopping process either. Drugs have always been a problem in our country and as long as we continue to be divided it will stay that way
A well deserved ratio for the man who campaigned on ignoring the border and then did it.
We have not seen a single drone attack on those who make &amp; sell this poison.
Closing the border &amp; finishing the wall would be cheaper.
Open Borders Biden….
Wait - Biden has caught more border hoppers? What the hell was Trump doing?
If you guys actually cared, you’d be doing something it’s the same broken record over and over again.
Let’s launch a surge of the same policies that have never worked
So you’re trying to party like it’s 1994? How’d it work out for the American people then?
That is a game of wak-a-mole.   Let's focus on harm reduction instead.   All those resources that could be used to heal the disease.
Absolutely!
Address the open border!
STOP WORKING WITH CHINA
China is sending it our way and is coming in through our border. Protect the border and the American people with deliberate action not political theater.
It’s flowing over the border you won’t protect
I suppose nobody bothered to clue him in...
knows exactly what he's doing.
Well, your letting is come across the borde every day by the thousands. So it’s your failure.
I thought the border was secure?
Where’s the Border “Czar”?
Novel idea. #Congress have been yelling for over two years about this VERY issue.  What about the people carrying it over the border? You arresting them, and
Gotta love when the people responsible for the issue act like they’re not the problem…
Seeing as how this is your border policy how do you think that you will stop the flow?
You started this chaos!!  Are you awake?  Is Pete B still employed??  Geez-Us!
If you’d secure the border………………….
Well that didn't take long,,,Close the Border Slow Joe!
Start with putting your son in prison for his crimes then we might take you seriously on this epidemic...  Until then you're just an enabler to the entire country's drug problems!
Come on Epstein!  Do you know the definition for the word "secure"?  Do you know what is meant by the phrase "southern border"?  If you answered yes to both, then all you need to do is merge them together to save thousands of lives!
It starts at our southern border, which is something you have failed to address.
crack down on
Leftists say fentanyl/hard drugs are smuggled through ports of entry.  Monday night in AZ - 1 single group of mules arrested by BP in a remote area (not a port or entry) with:  40 kilos of meth 11 kilos of fentanyl 4 kilos of coke 16 kilos of marijuana
But, they stopped them and seized these drugs. That’s what we want them to do. You are confused.
Thats like using a screen to protect yourself from rain…   Close the border, genius! 
Try securing the border for the first time in your long life
We all know where it is coming from and how it gets into the country.  Hold China accountable and seal up the nearly nonexistent border.
Getting people off fentanyl, into recovery and helping Americans build prosperous, happy lives will have a much greater impact. Both The trafficking and recovery sides need to be worked on here at base levels.
Close the God damn border you corrupt hypocrite. And get East Palestine some help, now!
OR, REINFORCE THE BORDER! What is wrong with you? WORST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME 
You and your homeland security director should be ashamed how you are letting fentanyl come thru our southern border. The Mexican cartels laugh at you.
Any reason you weren’t doing that until now? Seems like you could have been doing this the whole time. Why wait until now?
If only we had some sort of tall physical uninterrupted obstruction stretching across the border to prevent movement.  Like, Some sort of.... I don't know. Wall.
If you leave a window open a thief will come in but if you leave a door open you surely see more than 1.  Same with leaving Border open,  send in Nat Guard to help Border Patrol.  Again you are always late doing something.  Why?
Southern. Border.
close the border you nitwit
Good idea, genius 
Yet your own border patrol says your letting it come freely across the border.
Liar. Close the border and stop tweeting. You get fact checked in every single one.
Why don’t you do something like I don’t know maybe secure the border. That might be a good starting point.
Now you care?  Go away.
Build a wall &amp; make it tall. Not just 10 miles, 20 miles, 30 miles. Make one that covers the entire southern border. It would solve so many of our issues, but neither party has interest in doing that. Nice that we funded Israel’s wall tho, which cut illegals &amp; drug entries by 90%
Walls don't work they never have.  There's always to overcome an obstacle. If Trumps wall was to be built that wouldn't have stop anyone
Have you not paid any fucking attention at all? Trump's wall was being built &amp; in the places where it was finished illegal immigration was down to historic lows. When Biden got in office he cut off the funding earmarked for its completion. Not just that, he actually paid $$$
Oh yeah!  And Steve Bannon raised $25 million from hardworking Americans under the “build the wall” scam and promptly stole the money.  When Bannon pled guilty and was convicted of the associated felonies, donnie pardoned Bannon.  What was that all about?
How about a border wall? We know where it’s coming from man
China. Literally china. You need to do some real research instead of just listening to republican talking points.
Ever considered securing the boarder???
Yes, secure the border. President Trump gave u a secure border. Why did you destroy it ? Of course, no answer will arrive!
Or… maybe… just MAYBE… we can start protecting our border and stop the massive flow of fentanyl into our country.  But no… rather than take the real measures that would actually work, you’d rather play politics with the lives of our children.
Which measures are you proposing?   Why do you suppose fentanyl deaths increased during the last administration who had a major focus on the border?
They have increased majorly since Biden came into office. The flow of fentanyl was coming through here increased some during trumps administration, but Biden invited them and they came
Increase happened before Biden…  Also, most drugs come through a port of entry.
Looks like Biden has a crisis on his hands
Looks like deaths increased drastically before Biden. Didn’t the previous president prioritize the border? How could this happen with such focus on the border? 
How come Trump secure when the DemoRATS were fighting him when funding.  Can't blame Trump when he was ready to fully lock border.
If he secured the border, why did drug deaths from illegal drugs increase under Trump? 
Joe, we know you've been a big fan of the War on Drugs your entire career, even bragging that how you were harsher than Richard Nixon, the guy who invented it, but It. Doesn't. Work.  Want to reduce fentanyl deaths?  Decriminalize opiates!
Yeah. Kids don't smoke pot, take speed, or anything like that. All those little angels.
The chances of fentanyl being laced into weed are slim to none, literally nobody is going to do that. The fentanyl costs more to make than the weed itself.   And what kids do you know are out here doing methamphetamines? That is also not very common.
How about closing the border!! There’s a perfect place to start!! 
I have an idea  Ukraine Joe!  Secure our Borders!  You created this problem!
You’re losing border patrol agents daily, you’ve handcuffed ICE, and you’ve emboldened the drug cartels!! Your fingerprints are on every one of these horrific overdose deaths!! A liar should resign &amp; bring cackle bird with you!
You understand that Fentanyl pours into the country across the southern border that you opened up?   I mean, you do get this, right?  PS- Where is your “border czar” ?
It actually doesnt most of it is made and distributed by citizens just like our opioid crisis except thats big pharma
biden is pro-cartel and pro-drug trafficking
Dude, you’re like the fentanyl king of the United States, of which your son is probably the biggest customer. If you want to resolve the fentanyl problem, just throw yourself and your son in jail.
This has been tagged as #unethicalmedia for stigmatizing the disabled
Well is disabled
It comes from CHINA Joe... but you are compromised  "Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and sale" ...   RESIGN NOW
How does this dangerous drug make it into America?   Oh, that’s right the open border.
Close the border pez…. 
It’s called a Boarder Wall Not very complicated but effective as we have helped other Countries build them and Nancy even erected one around The Capital 
Most fentanyl comes from china, not mexico.
You can start by closing the southern border and deporting those here illegally.
And how many have you and BigPharma killed, Mr. Resident?
Just invade Mexico and build it back better.
Why not finish the wall, fully staff border patrol, and close the border. Then we can focus on ‘drug detection machines’.
Before any progress can begin we MUST put America first and remove the biggest obstacle, which is you Joe.
Just close the  southern border! You can't "detect fentanyl" when the cartel has people just running into our country with huge backpacks full of it! Give Border Patrol power back to stop them!
Agreed. Now, where exactly is the fentanyl coming from?
China
This is your fault, you rescinded all Trump's immigration laws the 1st day you came into office.
Might help if there is a border
President Trump had a handle on fentanyl.  A protected closed border and a conversation with Xi. Too bad you can't seem to do either.
Ohhhh please elaborate! What say you to the 77% of Fentanyl smuggled across the border is done by Americans?
all three of your tweets have been tagged as #unethicalmedia for stigmatizing the disabled. All three of your tweets are #inaccurate and you all are politicizing a life-saving medication for the disabled for greedy reasons
Ok close the border
How is he supposed to get all those votes? Wait, my bad the dead voters
This is a border issue. Please fix the border Mr. President.
Sorry it’s made in labs in California
WHY DON'T YOU CLOSE THE SOUTHERN BORDER ,MR. OPEN BORDERS
All the previous attempts to get this done have failed and this is the crisis of all administrations since Regan. We act like this is something that just happened when Biden took office. Been there for over three decades.
Nope. The last president we had was actively working on the problem but when this president came in the office, he stopped it.
Omg I have an idea, what if you CLOSED THE BORDER
Are you high?  Close the damn border. STOP illegal immigration. Build the wall (yes, it’s a deterrent)
Keep letting them cross the border and bring it in!!  How can anyone take anything you say seriously??
you should start a war on drugs
CLOSE THE BORDER 
Why? US Citizens are the ones smuggling it
Stop following me around Twitter, weirdo. BLOCKED.
YES, and we can end the flow once and for all by:    Bolstering border security to catch/deter drug smugglers;    Keeping #fentanyl analogs on the schedule list updated;    Pressuring #China, #India, and #Mexico to make #fentanyl a schedule narcotic in their countries.
A drug detection machine? What is that even mean? Sounds to me like another government waste of billions of dollars to no where. How about just secure our border, enforce our immigration laws and deport illegals?
You'd have to have control of the border to pull that one off, and we all know the cartels wont let you do that. Just ask and
How about close the damn border it’s flowing across
Fentanyl has been known to enter the U.S. at border crossings.  So “closing the border” for that purpose would mean ALL commerce crossing legally, as well.  #Misnomer #GOPDogWhistle
Drug prohibition has worked so well, hasn’t it? 
Your administration is the chief impediment for your own named issues; stopping the source and closing the border.   President Biden, you are the issue. Seal the border. Build the wall. Push harder on sanctions with China.
Or teach our Kids that substance abuse = death....easy peasy
You’d have to stop everyone at the border to do that, Joey…
Biden is over here creating problems and then failing to solve them...
Close the border.
How. Dare. You
Close the effing border MePaw
You're the one that's for open borders... It's literally your fault.
If you are unwilling and/or unable to stop undocumented immigrants from crossing the border and entering our country illegally, I find it laughable you profess you're going to stop drugs from crossing the border. #outoftouch
Close the border! Control the border. Stop the import of fentanyl. It’s not magic.
The.  Border. Is. Wide. Open.  !!!!! 
Mmmmmmm (whispers in the mic)…………….. East Palestine……. Not  a Joke  
You are the main cause of it.
might go into work tmrrw joe
You mean like to launched the major surge of it across the border?
How you gonna stop them at the border when you can’t even stop the migrants?
Where you been the last two years?
Close the border! Jack!
Pay our student loans
Now that u tweeted. I will be leaving Twitter and this country.I got my passport yesterday afternoon.Instead I’ll be moving to A CIVILIZED COUNTRY, the well respected Russia ! So long, America! You’ve just lost a citizen and twitter user.
IF YOU CLOSED THE BOARDER AND QUIT LETTING THE DRUGS IN IT WOULD HELP BRANDON!!! 
1/4  There are 3 choices. Which is less bad? 1) continue the failed drug war Legalize drugs &amp; tax &amp; regulate the crap out of them 3) Legalize drugs, tax them at the SAME rate as other goods, do NOT regulate them
Dude, the borders wide open, you might want to put in a wall first..just sayin
There isn't a Fentanyl problem. There is a counterfeit and contaminated drug supply problem. People add 1% Fentanyl to substances and it's in 87% of substances. Problem is, the other 99% are 2-5 different substances. Opioids are getting blamed, yet prohibition is the cause.
So you want to close the border you opened? A no brainer move!
First, Fentanyl killed George Floyd. Second, it's used by hospitals correctly. Third, YOU OPENED THE BORDERS, so IT'S YOUR FAULT.
Let's close the border. This is all on YOU!
Thanks to you open border policies!
You could have more resources battling a deadly drug like fentanyl if you legalized pot nationwide.
How about securing the border.
But prohibition doesn't work - didn't you guys learn anything from your failed alcohol prohibition a century ago?  There's only one way for the USA to minimize fentanyl deaths: make heroin, opioids and cocaine available to citizens through specialist drug clinics and pharmacies.
Or, hear me out here, you could lift one of your little girl grabbin fingers and help make a world where people don't need to escape with drugs?  Nah, expensive equipment and more brutal cops it is, gotta keep that 10% cut maxed out, eh?
That’s a lot more than by gun violence. I’m sure you’ll take this initiative seriously the way you try to end legal gun ownership. Didn’t you just cancel balloon monitoring of the border?
Stop throwing pain patients under the bus. Tell &amp; to stand down from prosecuting good faith docs (as SCOTUS instructed in Ruan), and get off her ass &amp; talking to state medical boards and legislators about restoring treatment to abandoned patients.
C’mon man. Have you learned nothing from your past mistakes on drug policy?
Wrong approach! Let's rather legalize heroin and other drugs so that there's no more need for fentanyl. If quality tested drugs are made available to people, there will be far fewer deaths related to these substances.  [1/3]
How about closing the borders?  You quote stats on interceptions, but they are a small percent of those getting through.
Close the Border!!!
I've a novel idea.  Build a border wall with limited access.
Fentanyl is made in China and smuggled through what used to be the southern border. Since January 20, 2021 we are a country without borders and almost without laws.
Can I have clean drinking water first?
About time. This country has known about the issue with fentanyl for far too long without doing something about it. Had you acted sooner my partner would still be alive. Now her kids have to grow without a mum in their lives and I'm left trying to mend the shattered pieces.
Close the border.
, so late on the issue you started and allow to happen ! What a joke
Sir, I am an average sort of woman, growing older. I retired from the Army, have grand kids, the requisite cats, am financially stable and have a verifiable medical condition which is both incurable and extremely painful. The current policy on opioids is killing  me. Please help.
YOUR FAULT FOR THE WIDE OPEN BORDER! You bare responsibility for every death that’s going to happen!!
The border??? Maybe???
Build ‘walls’  
SECURE BORDERS
Close the border =reduce Fentanyl.  A child could understand this.  But you are Buying those votes. WE All understand this 
Or, maybe try to control the border?
Prohibition is NOT the answer... was addicted myself - but this is not the way
Close the border...? Wow.. easy...
So is lack of healthcare. 68k+
10% for the Big Guy!
LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES NO NO NO ILLICIT FENTANYL is the problem
WRONG WRONG WRONG
how can we help you on this?
NO PLEASE NO IT IS ILLICIT  NOT REAL YOU ARE KILLING US!!!!
CLOSE THE BORDER SSABMUD 
Maybe u should read the OATH u took, s l o w l y. YOu took THIS OATH to protect the people OF THIS country....
Lets? No you. You have to do it.
Address China producing then. No one will stand up to them.
#BorderCrisis
Passing the buck again
Are the Great Lakes going to be safe?
You mean like building a wall 
Well that's a good idea you should have done that a long time ago. Maybe closing the border securing the border might help. Once again you guys create problems and then complain about them. That's always your way a day late and a dollar short. Glad you finally noticed the problem
13 days after China’s balloon was shot down from the USA air space, US Sec of State, A. Blinken and Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat met  Contact between the USA and China is crucial. Hopefully, communication will continue   #DemVoice1 #LiveBlue #ResistanceUnited #OneVoice https://t.co/hSi2IC10Fp
The Chinese spy balloon drama from inside China https://t.co/9fuERB7Pc5
When the Chinese spy balloon flew across our homeland, Biden did not brief Governors. He activated National Guard resources without consulting with us. He kept us in the dark.  We need leadership in the White House that answers the American people’s questions. https://t.co/sSzCn6hyu2
Take back the National Guard to State control and get rid of the Federal Control.
I would be glad to find an image showing the flight path of that balloon and how it flew right over Rapid City and all of our military installation including our damn! You’re always worried about someone poisoning our water from there… Answers please
He needs to be impeached.  It is really simple.
And who respects states’ rights.
Newsmax. 
Oh yeah because you are SO transparent 
It's actually treasonous that the Biden Regime did not discuss the "balloons" with the affected state's Governors and Congressmen as it was happening.  Thank you, as always, for speaking out about the issue.   Where are the other affected Governors?  Reclaim States' Rights!
This women gets hotter  everyday
He didn't consult you - with your vast expertise on military operations and foreign policy??? Shocking. He would with the military and followed their advice.  You're still polling at 1% for that VP office. Remember when you told SD citizens that you weren't interested in running?
Have I mentioned that I believe should be on the #2024 ticket with #Trump
I wouldn’t consult her on lunch choices.
SD needs leadership and their questions answered. You are doing neither.
Noem is never caught telling the truth.
Just goes to show POTUS has better things to do then talk to a bunch of clowns 
People who have served in the military understand the concept of "need to know."   If you "need to know" you know.   If you don't "need to know" you don't know.   You don't need to know. That's why you weren't told.
You’re a piece of work, Kristi!
Did you consult with him when you sent our National Guard troops to Texas?? And discuss with him where the money came from??
You have no national security clearance. You are a thereat to national security. Stay in your own lane.
Well, Kristi...hate to point out the obvious, but...need to know...does that mean anything to you?  And if they had said, "Hey, look! A balloon!" Would you have believed them?  Go back to fighting for fireworks, Kristi...stay in your lane.
Wait a minute. You announced on Twitter that you had a conversation with administration concerning but you said there were unanswered questions. When do you ever tell the truth.  #liar
Kristi Noem 2024 in the White House
Counting on you for President,  2024.  I will help in Tennessee.
Someone  is running for P.O.T.U.S  Notice too that she NEVER talks about the blatantly stolen 2020 General Election or the 2022 Mid-Term Election 
In China, we would not expect regional leaders to be informed about top secret intelligence operations.
How much does this guy have to do before he gets impeached?
There is a much, much bigger gambit playing out than Chinese balloons. Dramatically bigger.  The learning curve is steep on this one.
If you think he’s leading the country you have your head in the sand.
How many of Hunter's finger paintings did China have to buy to clear passage for their spy balloon?
The peoples governor.
Ever hear of the concept in security matters of "Need to know"?  Why do you feel that you need to know what was going on in what clearly was a federal matter?
Brandon is compromised
He has broken so many laws its not even funny. This is yet another reason he should be impeached and removed from office for high crimes and misdemeanors as well as not upholding his oath of office
Well, she's out.
Maybe because you spend all day making up lies to attack him politically? You can't be trusted.
Governor's must now fend for there selves and their constituents. God bless you
Newsmax really?
He worked with the Pentagon.  Good enough.
Action is needed
Hello around the bend  Or  Going away by Easter
We don’t just need leadership in the White House…we need leadership in all facets of government
Bingo!
Pump up your lips some more krusty! Those DSLs spew nothing but hate and gaslighting
Sorry, Putin was not born in America!
I’m not defending Biden, but I’m sure he had no idea what was going on either, and whoever is actually in charge, has no intention of informing anyone.
You have a track record of being a spreader of lies and propaganda...
We need leaders that don’t panic….
Oh now you are on Newsmax.  Fox News reject you and your lies. That’s pretty pathetic
Looks like she's had her lips done.
Hmm different story a week ago
Interesting. 
No, we need leadership to take action... just like he did.
Well, Noem, this was a "need to know" issue.  Considering the fact that you have no national security clearance and you're a low guy on the totem pole, you didn't need to know.  Stay in your lane.
Clearly, the Pentagon is usurping the state's rights...clearly violating the Constitution!
yea I am sure the pentagon really thinks hey we should contact krusti
If Biden didn’t brief governors about the balloon than what was this tweet about??
Twitter remembers.
Another day if this…
He called you. You were at a cheap motel with your latest fling and didn’t want to be disturbed. Come clean.
You don't get brief on things you don't know. Typically things dealing with national security are not a Gov need to know
Oh Krissy…somehow I suspect you’ve spent most of your adult life in the dark…just sayin…
You have leadership you are not a leader when you use your position to help your daughter sit down
Maybe you should focus on your state's own problems instead of chasing airtime.
"We need leadership in the White House that answers the American people’s questions."  Absolutely true!  Why did the GOP foment a violent and deadly insurrection in an attempt to overthrow the will of the people?   Trump's white house still will not answer this question.
If you are so concerned, why did you blow off the governor’s dinner at the White House? You were already in DC speaking to fellow Christofascists, but you couldn’t be bothered to attend a bipartisan dinner with the President.  You are a fear monger &amp; a fraud.
Did you consult Biden when you sent South Dakota National Guard to the southern border for a political stunt?  Didn't think so.
You are a waste of taxpayer's funds.
That's because all Joe sees is color... Black White Blue Red
We need leaders who do not work for China!
Their is leadership, but not the way you think!
Do you really think this was the first time China had spy balloons.  Before you know it, they will be hacking #Gaslight
Plain and simple, compromised! And will go down in history that way.
Just wondering if your NG commanding General was ordered by the federal government to do...Anything without informing the states leader who is he working for then?
WHAT IF! What would have happened if they were armed? It doesn't take much for biological, nuclear or other weapons
That's because he's a backstabbing dictator
Expert on everything when in front of a camera. 
Can we send some balloons to China airspace to see how they reacts?
He is doing a better job than the previous so called administration who didn't do anything about 3 balloons
You were on a WH call on 2/3 Or was that a lie?
Good luck with that.
Governor we need effective leadership period. This administration is the weakest most disgraceful in my 57 years of life. Absolutely inept and pathetic
The mushroom effect.
GFY Trunt
Nobody cares. You govern 87 people. . . .
Do you say anything this isn't half a lie or exaggeration?  Why don't the people of SD see this?
Because you’re a MAGA insider. You would have welcomed the commies.
She abused her power to give her kid an advantage in getting a job. Its called corruption.
Let's talk about the railway and vinyl chloride is a carcinogen, and burning it releases hydrogen chloride and phosgene – and it’s this that the Allied powers (but also Germany) used during WWI. Phosgene was used extensively during World War I as a choking (pulmonary) agent.
So now you are complaining that he took action. So when a nuke is headed to the United States. He should not act till he talks with you and others.  Guess you forget he is commander and chief, the constitution does not say he has to answer to you, or advise you in national def.
Keep flailing
You abused your office.
Remember how that one Governor did not do a press conference on COVID for months and months at the height of it? But, sure, complain about communication.
Honey, you’ve been wandering around in the dark for some time now..
President Biden waited until he had all the facts to speak about the balloon. Unlike republicans who spread misinformation and lies about a deadly world wide pandemic
Weird.  Why did the National Guard follow orders from Biden?
Why is your National Guard activated without u knowing?
When the Chinese spy balloon flew across our homeland ... they already knew that T. Denny Sanford bribed his way out of going to prison for child p0rn ped0philia thanks to the financial arrangements he made with Kristi Noem.
What questions did Trump answer about the spy balloons flying across our skies on his watch?  At least Biden neutralized the one spy balloon on his watch, then had it shot down and recovered.
Oh, please.
Kristi complains about national issues but refuses to hold a press conference to answer questions about state or local issues. South Dakota is a distant second while Noem seeks a better job.
That's why we have the military.  Did it affect you, NO!  Did it affect anyone on land or air, NO Did it harm anyone, NO!  They don't blabber, they keep things quiet, need to know basis instead of yapping non-stop to create chaos. They did their job and they did it well. The end!
Like when you intimidated Sherry Bren so your daughter finally got her estate appraisal licence approved? That was real leadership huh Kristy?
Good!
I am wondering why he didn’t brief governors.  You all freaked out when you heard about it.
How’s your conversion therapy going?
Participated in a phone call with the White House tonight about the Chinese spy balloon. A lot of my questions still unanswered.
Sniveling again.
Does he really need to consult with the Governors?  
A phony complaint.
Nonsense.
"NewsMax" is where the truth goes to die. You are a liar.
Your homeland is Russia, comrade.
About the way you govern
Shut up
He tried calling but you were in a meeting about Fourth of July fireworks.  Or maybe it was making calls to get your daughter an appraisers licensure?
Rage baiting Kristi.
Like you? Please no!!
I thought the red states want the Federal govt to stay out of their business. So then, why do you want to be briefed by Biden? You can’t have it both ways.
doesn’t need your approval.
So you admit he took action
Stop LYING…tweets (2/3/23) are forever!
Fk off traitor
you mean the kind of ‘leadership’ displayed by Trump when HE LIED TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR WEEKS ABOUT THE LETHALITY OF COVID AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED?!
We need leaders that aren’t Transphobic Trump-Fluffers such as yourself.
Yeah, I wouldn't trust you either
Just curious, did the CO of the National Guard unit notify you when the White House activated them?
#MountRushmoron Most governors cordoned to protect people, while Kristi Noem (R-SD) let Covid-19 sicken and kill for the vanity of Trump. Mount Rushmoron features Noem, Doug Burgum (R-ND), Mark Gordon (R-WY), and Kim Reynolds (R-IA).  Better ask New Hampshire for more granite.
The Chinese have satellites that can read a license plate. Why would they bother with a balloon?
Need a tissue?
Such a waste of hottness.
Yes we do!
#impeachbidenNOW
This lady is unbelievable and awesome!! What a gem
Makes sense.  See in 700 days when we are able to seat an “Elected” president.
correct
Poor leadership and lack of respect for our States leaders. Only dictatorship runs top down
Well thats pretty much how this nation feels like since he took office. We feel like he has left this whole nation in the dark about everything. So we feel ya. 
People like you should be thoroughly investigated by FBI and DHS and all your financial transactions dating 10 years back analyzed!!!! And, hopefully, removed from office and prosecuted?
Who cares
That is an illegal act
You seem so smart, Kristi.
But republicans don't understand the balloon is full of air.
Biden displayed leadership. Still is, why should he consult with you? You support disproven conspiracies, and a republican party that is cowtowing to donors and their lobbyists. He is pro-america.
Shot up apparently you have no idea how the system works
You and Desantis need to team up for the Whitehouse.  You both are the best Republicans  with the right stance.
Yaaaaawwwwwn ##GOPLiesAboutEverything
Lol you had a miniature of Mount Rushmore made with Trumps face added to it.
Noem, you do realize how pathetic you look to most Americans?
Really? Trump would have done worse like never even noticing the Chinese spy balloons and just letting them go. He did that at least three 3x's! Biden did something and didn't need your permission!
Sit down clown 
#trash #liar #GOPClownShowContinues
Kirsti, when you go against the herd, you will get nothing but grief. By the same token it is a sign you doing something right.
Are you still relevant?
Nobody has any idea what you are even talking about.
They hate America that's why
Please tell me that South Dakota is securing our hazardous chemical sites and transportation for said chemicals. Take extra security measures. Please.
How about we need people in the Governor's Mansion that actually answer South Dakotan's questions?!? Or even care about them???
Bidens world
#ravnsborg
#TrumpBlimpWimp Under President Biden, a #ChineseSpyBalloon was detected and shot down. Under Trump, three Chinese Spy Balloons travelled the US without Trump lifting a finger. Maybe they looked too much like a lied that Trump would shoot them down.
#FlightBlindness The is afflicted with a type of blindess where they can see the possible misdeeds of Democrats, but cannot see at all the misdeeds of Republicans, especially the shenanigans of and are particularly #BlindedByTheFlight.
Ted Cruz is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Mitch McConnell is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Steve Bannon is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Louis DeJoy is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Jared Kushner is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
Trump is a #ChineseSpyBalloon
He doesn’t need to ask permission, he’s the ultimate command authority. CIC
Stop channeling T____p. Your reputation is bad enough as it is.
Yeah because Trumpy was so open. Duh
You'll never get immediate answers when it comes to national security to prevent leaking. That is not only common sense, it has been that way since we invented national security.
Shut-up. When Trump: invited Russians into the Oval and provide them with classified information; stood with Putin in Helsinki; attempted to extort Ukrainian leader; incited an insurrection; attempted a coup; stole classified documents, you said nothing.  DISGUSTING/UNPATRIOTIC
Under Federal law he can do that.  Remember Trump wanted to use national guard to crush protestors even had an unmarked army busting heads running amok against Americans. Biden also took safety of citizens into consideration Trump considers himself above country.
So you’re mad because he’s leading?
Letting you fly fireworks this year?
Because you can’t be trusted on national security issues.
Look at me! Look at me! I want to be president!  I'll shoot at anything! Look at me!  The GOP is hypocrisy, deceit and shameless ambition.
okay and who would that be? Donald Trump has admitted to a laundry list of lies he told while in office so can't be him.
The President has final control of the National Guard and doesn't have to answer to the states for their control when he wants to use them...This is per Congress and goes back to 1600's.
You're referring to yourself, I assume.
No you need to push back and govern your state
 you keeping taking rights away from women and you want rights to know about some weather balloons. Let’s get your priorities right
Weren't you listening? It was already explained. He didn't go half cocked by telling them in advance about what's going on. He played it safe until he received the advice from military advisors to act or not. He went by their advice to act.
Did you get briefed when they flew overhead during the previous administration? #RepublicansAreTheProblem
You really don’t rank as any legitimate leader… so get used to it …
what america needs isn't anything your selling
Poor little girl…
A profile in courage? Thanks for the comedy.
Blah Blah Blah - lots of Rhetoric- Blah
Maybe he did but left you out…
Because Mz Noem you can't be trusted with Top Security Intel  Clear now ????
I guess this one is gonna try and be like Boebert and Green. Make BIG money by spreading lies on Twitter.  Maybe she's another one that's in PUTIN'S pocket.
Definitely a spy balloon from China, spotted flying over the US.
hmmm...shooting down hobby balloons, how can you tell us China had balloons sent during the Trump Admin., your intel was not very accurate in the beginning of all of this.  And Trump did no have an incident that they tracked from Chin to our Atlantic.  There are no excuses !!!
China offers ‘no apology’ in first meeting after spy balloon incident, Blinken says https://t.co/KhPXTGbTs0
quite telling language, apparently africa is like a giant piece of pie, without any agency of their own, africa was in the hands of europeans for centuries, what came out of it? from a rich thriving region to abject poverty, china went thru the same painful history, they can help https://t.co/z9XbwofDsw
why post a video with no context? does one single case represents what's happening all over africa? are you dumb enough to think a small number of cases is the same as the systemic plunder of africa by europeans? the mass shipping of slaves to n. america?
These “Western Imperialist” should reflect on what they have done in Africa the past century. Instead of helping Africa succeed, they plunder, loot and enslave the people of Africa for their own selfish gain. Today, China is changing the narrative by providing actual assistance
african countries are slowly moving towards true sovereignty, that's what these neo-colonialists fear most
Somewhere, I have a picture of how much farmland European countries 'now' own in Africa.. Is it because they have no control over population #'s, and soon fear Starvation..??
The Anglo states do not like that another country is helping a whole continent to remove the shackles of slavery to become powerful. They know once that happens they can not dictate terms there ....
Cobalt Mine under China Company.... This is the New World Order
Some people never learn. Always the same story of the beautiful garden of Western/European civilization against orcs and savages of the jungle.
This gardener thinks the Europeans still own Africa
These EUROPEANS THIEVES failed to mentioning their own products
I've always wondered why diplomats from countries that are in shambles, such as Italy, would send someone to give advice to other countries on what to do in order to prosper.
Maybe Africans can be left to make their decisions. EU overlording does not work any longer
Ukrainians don’t like Zelensky. He promised peace (unlike the other election candidates) and he broke his word. Ukrainians did not forget how he betrayed them.   “We chose a clown. Now we are being entertained.”
China would still have to clean up the mess,pillage,racist leftovers of the BRITISH...
After what the Europeans have done to Africa, it is amazing they can still talk like that. Can only be explained if they feel a sense of entitlement, of moral superiority not only above that of Africans, but of everybody else.   In other words, they are fucking racists.
The “China virus” has a name. It’s corona virus or Covid-19. The balloon has no name at this time but it is from China so he’s grammatically correct to call it such. Next?
Whenever a Republican uses "woke" as a diss, the next question should be: "What exactly do you mean by 'woke?'"
He’s campaigning against being woke. I too want to know what his definition is of woke.
A woke person will say you are racist for saying chinese virus but will proclaim Biden shot down a chinese balloon. Are you starting to get it now?
Funny how governments that have been compromised by China have no interest in finding out where the China virus came from eh? Like the US and Canada?
You listen to too many conspiracy theorists.
Liberals were calling it the China balloon before they knew it was from China. Why is that?
Zelenskyy: Should China Ally With Russia, There Would Be a World War https://t.co/uzdTAgaTlw
Chinese products, Chinese virus and now Chinese Balloons. We need a break from China.
We got another damn balloon
... And we were worried about balloons from China 😜😜 #ChineseSpyBalloon  #KaylaLemieux
PLOT TWIST: Kayla Lemieux is based?
After shooting China’s weather balloon, Blinken expects to receive a warm welcoming from China…lol
Washington Post columnist: "Blinken’s outreach did have one small victory: At least now the rest of the world can see that the United States is not the obstacle."
CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE IN THE UKRAINE TOGETHER ALREADY! WHY DO U SEE CHINA MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH BALLOONS AND TAIWAN! CCP AND PLA ARE PUSHING XI FOR WAR! BIDEN NOW WANTS "WHO" TO RUN FACE MASK AND LOCKDOWNS WITH COVID AND THAT IS STRAIGHT COMMUNISM IN AMERICA FROM WHITE HOUSE!
Soap Twitter has become completely unhinged. We could be talking about the earthquakes in Turkey or spy balloons from China and it somehow becomes about John and Marlena. Y’all are insane. #DAYS
The US and China came to Germany last weekend looking to patch up a new rift opened by the uproar over a Chinese balloon.   Instead Antony Blinken and Wang Yi traded barbs on everything from the balloon to North Russia https://t.co/QgVXQFCdFm
North Russia? Is there a South Russia too?
I will keep on testifying about Mr Gabriel Eduardo . Because now I can invest with so much confidence of making profits and making all my withdrawal's, Make decision to invest now tomorrow might be too late. If you are interested. 
It was predictable, no matter China did, they won’t admit it was their fault, Xi Jinping‘a Face is thicker than the rubber shoe base.
Blinken should avoid any future meetings. Every time he meets a Chinese delegation, he is owned and humiliated. The man is weak and they know it.
Goodyear put in a request to the Biden administration to please not shoot down their Blimp
We’re screwed now…
This is not helping things! We need a good relationship with China! Fix this!
China is acting as the only adult in the room by willing to provide diplomatic support for a peace agreement on Ukraine. The US and NATO kids just discussing how to escalate the war 
If America is silent, the world will find peace.
Don’t trust him.
Blinken came to point fingers.  Not to heal rifts
"Well, that was quick. All better now, I guess?"
I've never heard about there being a geographic or geopolitical conception that so-called North Russia. Maybe you refer to North Korea?
Shocking hammer damage hell ass kick out suspended sos Blinken banned romove end over exchange suspended sanctions don’t touch call name China 
China wants Taiwan, it's only gonna get worse.
 Not surprising that liberal wing of MSM is ignoring Hersh's Nord Stream article. IF mainly accurate, huge IF, it would have a HUGE negative impact on their Dems , maybe all the way to the impeachment of Conservative wing twitter.com/lieven_anatol/…
Clicked to find out what the heck North Russia is and should I be concerned.
... And we were worried about balloons from China 😜😜 #ChineseSpyBalloon  #KaylaLemieux #fullofhotair
The leftists all over the world have colluded with the CCP, and now is the time to suffer. U.S. and Canada hardest hit. Iranian president visited China and brought back many big balloons from the CCP of China.  you will see the weather balloons that the CCP calls appearing over https://t.co/qbs82UebO7
Yes I’m locked from posting but I can comment? I noticed two missals to shoot down balloons?   Nope the DOD wants to refigure them as Russian or China missals and use them on us to start a war. Anything to surrender our Constitution.  Stay frosty we’re winning. https://t.co/5Hk4BRgwJ1
Killer pigeons from outer space to combat China spy balloons we will get them hyped up on crack and train them to attack balloons
Everyone acts like our military is all that strong lol.. When we have balloons from China flying in undetected 🫠
Kim Jong Un's sister warns the U.S. that unless it stops conducting military exercises with its allies in the region, North Korea will turn the Pacific Ocean into a "firing range"
The US can also press a button and absolutely leave zero traces of north korea behind
Lol dude we are unmatched in every aspect of war.
Well the US has the strongest military in the entire world… by a universal margin.
our politics are weak rn, not our power. well be ostracized by our own people for using our power, the real war is within.
We also have active spies in the U.S. so what's your point?  English is still our nation's language. Come back when it changes to Mandarin or Cantonese and we're under Chinese rule.
the only reason that balloon got into the country is because our government let it, it wasn’t undetected.
Its easier to detect military planes than a fuckin rubber ballon you walnut
I had a buddy say the media was using the stupid balloons to distract from some of the current events, but who said pfizer asked china to send a balloon? lol
James O’Keefe lost his company to a tale as old as time - Talent vs. Suits.
... And we were worried about balloons from China 😜😜 #ChineseSpyBalloon  #KaylaLemieux
You should be the last person talking about fashion. As you wore the China balloon to the State of the union. Zelensky came from a war zone. And returned to war. https://t.co/6T2kBpl2PX
How'd we go from Chinese spy balloons to Russian ones?  I am not worried about Russia.  I am worried about China.  In part, because, we've never seen their military in action.  We don't really know what their capabilities are.  They are an "unknown variable".
Remember when Democrats claimed the spy balloon was shot down as soon as it was identified? Bullshit. It has now been confirmed they reportedly tracked the Spy Balloon for over a week from the time it left China until after it covered thousands of miles inside US air space.
During his meeting with China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, US Secretary of State Blinken cautioned against any assistance from China that could help Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

TO CHINA.....FROM AMERICA  STOP SENDING YOUR BALLOONS TO  ** O U R ** COUNTRY AND * W E * WON'T SHOOT THEM DOWN!!!!  HOW'S THAT!!??
Ron should check the playbook. This month big crisis is  balloons from China. The border “crisis” is later on closer to an election.
Oh Zip It! 🤐 If Americans want to send up Balloons &amp; initiate a Joke then so be it, &amp; if we shoot it down, we shoot it down bc you guys Claimed the First One Was From China! Show us the Proof how you knew it was from China! It could of came from Iran? Djibouti? "Made in China?"
Now do #45 and the several balloons he hid from Americans and why he took millions from the Saudi's, Russia, and China.
I was watching a YT video from about these UFO/balloons and I DIED when I found out China tried to say its a weather balloon at first. Then said they have seen them too 🤣🤣 OK 👍 SUUURE.
With the way things are going, there needs to be some kind of change.  Balloons from China, train derailments with chemical spills, billions of dollars going to ukraine, shady stuff happening in our government, and random attacks on innocent people.  A change is needed.
Marge calls for red states to secede.  On Presidents’ Day.  This is sedition.
... And we were worried about balloons from China  😜
These are appearing many places. It is residue from the balloons launched by China
Crazy how Russia and China didn't do shit when trump was in office. Oh wait, they had weather balloons here lol.  We could have sent all the equipment from Afghanistan to Ukraine instead of giving to the taliban...
A senile and a former actor. Nice
both presidents and leaders of their respective countries and peoples. who are you again?
I didn't say they weren't presidents. I said Joe is senile (he is) and zelensky is a former actor (he is.)
Ah, like Reagan.
And trump
Yes, many rich actors. Wait now I’m confused at how this was a dig.
Bc the pic isn't hard and we shouldn't be wasting our money for Ukrainians pensions when we got our own shit to deal with here
Right, your point is actually every virgin walks through a bombing raid and america is safer if russia and china can conquer whoever they want.  What a soy boy you are lmao
“Biden is bad for letting the invasion of Ukraine  and also we shouldn’t aid Ukraine. I have political views beyond being angry that nobody respects me.”  Beta males, I swear.
Our military resources are far from depleted. Spy balloons are nothing to worry about.  Satellites, different story. Trumps daughter got hundreds of paten5s fast tracked in China and Kushner got over 2 billion from the saudis. nervous yet?
No explanation from China basically  confirms it was a spy balloon
In the evening, Messrs. Blinken and Wang sat down for an hourlong meeting that wasn’t publicly scheduled, and Mr. Blinken told his counterpart that China’s surveillance balloon program “has been exposed to the world,” according to the State Department.
One member of the Chinese delegation said the meeting "paved the way for the resumption of future high-level dialogue between the two sides, and the two countries can now talk beyond the balloon issue…on some other pressing issues.”
It wasn’t clear whether the sit-down would clear the air. China didn’t offer “anything that provides any kind of credible explanation as to what this balloon was,” a State Department official said. “It’s safe to say there was no apology," Mr. Blinken said.

How about banning 🇨🇳 China spy balloons from entering USA ... get serious about your job. So far clown 🤡 show ...
We’re working to ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill.   These fees can cost up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.    It just isn’t right.
Ok, but even if that becomes true, look how long it took us to detect a balloon from China? Plus, we had to shoot down the Chinese balloon flying over Canada. Why TF couldn’t they shoot down their own trespassing balloon? We’re fucked with in charge.
"China had promised to send a strong message back, while also pointing out that the US has breached Chinese airspace ten times in the last year with balloons" ⬆️ Full commentary from ZERO HEDGE above
Just a quick question and balloons be damned: What are we doing to protect the #American public from the #Fentanyl #China knowingly invades our country with? That balloon was just a distraction bty. Please. Mahalo! 🌺☠️
“It’s now time to impose costs on China because, from the very beginning of this war, Beijing has been backing Russia to the hilt." https://t.co/9JC4M3NO9y
But, but, but...you mean Biden lied and knew about it since launch because they did not want to interfere with Blinken's trip to China?  GASP! https://t.co/JcoCh0CVfE
I love the irony that psychopaths spent 3 years trying to trap the air, then a f#cken balloon with trapped air allegedly from China, "Oh, blow it up, release that air".  Honestly, it has been the single stupidest era in human history. Absolute circus.
The result of no teaching of real Science any more.
Peak stupidity.
Herpes and syphillis/lyme is a dreadful combo for the mind. No "education" is going to solve this downward spiral. Selective breeding and quarantining is the only way out. Of course that won't happen, so enjoy the collapse as entertainment...seems like you are doing that!

China is set to send their top diplomat to Russia.    Meanwhile, Biden has not picked up the phone to discuss the balloon that China sent over US skies.  Now the US has warned China to refrain from sending military aid to Russia.    Why hasn’t clueless Biden picked up the phone?

What was that? Same question
Haven't seen you travel to Ukraine.
What's really an embarrassment is how US Congress-members in the top clearance committees can't properly articulate the truth: that counterintelligence took place and that the balloon was jammed and used to counter-spy and decipher Chinese Army signal protocols.
Explain the difference between a balloon traveling over US airspace and a satellite. Also, please explain what you're doing to defuse tensions rather than exploit them for political purposes. It will help you focus during your response if you put away your wife's credit card.
You've been in Congress for ..... 18 years... since 2005?  What have you done to resolve some of these issues.  Stop pointing fingers &amp; get something positive done for the American people.

quite telling language, apparently africa is like a giant piece of pie, without any agency of their own, africa was in the hands of europeans for centuries, what came out of it? from a rich thriving region to abject poverty, china went thru the same painful history, they can help https://t.co/z9XbwofDsw
african countries are slowly moving towards true sovereignty, that's what these neo-colonialists fear most
Somewhere, I have a picture of how much farmland European countries 'now' own in Africa.. Is it because they have no control over population #'s, and soon fear Starvation..??
The Anglo states do not like that another country is helping a whole continent to remove the shackles of slavery to become powerful. They know once that happens they can not dictate terms there ....
Cobalt Mine under China Company.... This is the New World Order
Some people never learn. Always the same story of the beautiful garden of Western/European civilization against orcs and savages of the jungle.
This gardener thinks the Europeans still own Africa
These EUROPEANS THIEVES failed to mentioning their own products
I've always wondered why diplomats from countries that are in shambles, such as Italy, would send someone to give advice to other countries on what to do in order to prosper.
Maybe Africans can be left to make their decisions. EU overlording does not work any longer
Ukrainians don’t like Zelensky. He promised peace (unlike the other election candidates) and he broke his word. Ukrainians did not forget how he betrayed them.   “We chose a clown. Now we are being entertained.”
China would still have to clean up the mess,pillage,racist leftovers of the BRITISH...
After what the Europeans have done to Africa, it is amazing they can still talk like that. Can only be explained if they feel a sense of entitlement, of moral superiority not only above that of Africans, but of everybody else.   In other words, they are fucking racists.

BREAKING REPORT: US intelligence confirms Chinese spy balloon WAS part of GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE OPERATION to collect information on military sites across the world..
Wait till you hear about Chinese satellites above American soil.   Sorry bud, but your media is the one that got you all riled up.  Good sheep. They are proud of you
Glad the US intelligence agencies finally confirmed something we already knew.  Now can they tell us if it was related to the worldwide outages of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram yesterday?...
I thought that too, like it was EMP practice run. It was capable of dropping little bird size drones.
it's funny that worldwide outages happen after a story came out about Biden bombing the pipeline
Well, this isn’t new. Can you count?
Only one of them was allowed to traverse nearly the entire United States.   Oh and you left out the small hobby bloom Biden had shot down using two $400,000 missiles over lake Huron.  Frigging clownshow.
Biden? Did he push the bottom?  Wow
This is what a $850B DOD and   highly classified intel  budgets get us...a wanting capability to detect/handle Chinese spy balloons?
No you don't get it.  The deep state wants to do anything possible to undermine America.   This is just another page in a huge book of their crimes against America.
All intentional
10% for the big guy.
Yea sure.
I can help you be faster… just saying… there’s multiple examples… 
Here’s one
Should we believe US INTELLIGENCE? They’re kind of shady.
Information on what is possible
This whole time I thought it was a weather ballon.  Can’t believe it !!
And that US was not able to scramble tracking equipment -
Don't buy it. A big white balloon in the sky that blocks their satellites
Whoopsie doopsie
Thank you for that little Sir Echo.
And we let it do just that… awesome
Good story bro.
So now we know for a fact that they are not a global surveillance operation.
Yay!! We should all download the app babble to learn mandarin when Xi takes is over 
So why are we giving it back?
I knew that last week. Maybe I should be a part of US IC…
Data is king
#impeachbiden
Biden and the Pentagon allowed it. All are traitors!
Oh wow. How nice. Thank you Joey…
Sounds like they ready to make moves to change world domination, they slid through our block and no one did anything
We certainly helped them with that endeavor
We are SO surprised.    It's what they DO!
They needed a balloon for that? They don’t have satellites?
and biden let them do their job in this country...he should be impeached for dereliction of duty.
Where is the Beef? This has been know for a long time. Because the PUBLIC are asleep and remain in a coma of complacency its no surprise that the DOD likes it that way.
What!? No 
What a surprise.  Not.
And they allowed to happen
Good thing we let go across the whole country.
And to test capability of spreading toxins around the world
Shocking
shocked
ItS jUSt a wEaTheR bAllOoN 
Boom!
Because we can trust "US intelligence" right? 
I use google earth. I also avoid US intelligence
Boy they told us it was a harmless weather balloon
Um bullshit..
Kind of like a giant floating TikTok app.
Biden has to go!
Don't they already have satellites?
Why not
Wish I could say I was shocked.
And It was known at the onset yet allowed by this Admin.
Shocked that Trudeau did absolutely nothing to the balloon before it flew south of the Canadian border!  Both leaders were all part of this !
Which was jammed/blocked from spying this time, and we can now collect info from China.
Well Mahayana have ours so its very successful
Don’t you think they have satellites for that stuff. Come on man…
And the Chinese conducted their operation with the use of spyware that can be spotted with the unaided eye
This isnt breaking, as soon as it was spotted patriots already knew it was a spy balloon
I'm still laughing at the fact that China decided to fly a balloon to spy and got mad when we shot it down.
In other news, water is wet
I'm old enough to remember when we all believed "US intelligence" was an oxymoron.
Act of war
I’m sure they will share the info
…and Biden just let them! clearly bc he truly is a PRC agent!
So it finished its job
This balloon is here only to make sure households are making authentic Mexican tacos
The degree to which Biden sold this country out is mind blowing
Nooo that can't be right,they would never do that
Can't use any of  the satellite's up there,you need balloons....right ...
What? Thought it was a weather balloon. Hmm
Of course it was.
Then why did they let it go throughout the country?
is the International
No Kidding, We all new that last week
Ya think
The migrants will still be pouring in though!!
It was their own balloons! Or satellites! Bhahaha 
Did anyone think it was for a different reason? We are in danger of being attacked and our administration is not up to the task of protecting us!
And we still got that guy in the W H. Ain't looking to good for the Home Team now days !!
Blind Biden.
US Intelligence 
Source ?
So US intelligence just threw a truth bomb at us for the first time ever? NOT.  Now we know what it wasnt
Intelligence Community: 100,000 bureaucrats making $150k per year telling us something that the public knew last Saturday
Act of war
at this  point anything coming out of the USA have lost credibility... everything    Everyone knows... who started #WokeWarIII 
Isn’t that something. And we just let them stay in the sky for a week or two.
is this going to be on nation news
Let’s fight
Just learning this...WHAT ELSE!!!
Not possible. Biden said yesterday it was not a big deal. Now know why b/c it happens all the time.
That way they exactly were to strike and with what force.
And Canada's Safety Minister the liar let it float  on by Canada without a word.   He probably waved hello too.
No wonder they skipped right over Canada! We gave all our shit to Ukraine 
“US intelligence confirms “.  Is usually a lie
Well color me shocked 
They are all on the same team and trust me we ain't part of it!
Ya think????
You don't say!
Link to report?
And Biden let it wander around all that time....
No surprise
And the “experts” are in charge. Dear Lord, HELP US PLEASE!!
Well I’m sure they saw the inclusive state of our military and decided they have no worries!
Got this yesterday any one else
We know that already 
Just great.   Biden.  You suck!
Treason
The balloon was just a love note from China to Washington politicians reminding them who is their master
Shocker!
And our civilian military leadership was not informed!! Was it not part of ANY National Security Brief given to all Presidents on a very regular basis? How often does Biden listen to or decline the brief? Milley evidently has a hot line to his counterpart. He ever bring it up?
And Biden allowed them to do so.
Tomorrow they will tell us that sunlight helps the plants grow.
Chinese eh?!
Wow Sherlock what an observation! I thought they sent it here to hang out
The Chinese have satellites that can do this. Why would they send big massive balloons? Not very inconspicuous is it?
Duh!!!
DUHHHHH!!!!
Why is anyone surprised 
nothing breaking there
And Biden gave it all to them!
Oh really?  When will they confirm this?
surprise!    Who would have imagined.  I'm so happy we let them take all the data.
Well duh I could have told you that.   Biden, gotta pay up somehow
Well it’s a good thing we allowed them to complete their mission over the US
what we gonna do about it?? nothing... with this president..
Since when do we believe a word that the intelligence community says. We all know the FBI and CIA are absolutely corrupt
The balloon was used as a distraction to classified Documents and #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed . Was it really a Chinese balloon 
Smh... Or it was a white hat operation.  Let's face it... the Balloon didn't come from China.
And collect US streaming data relating to economic transactions...all those business sites now glitching..?
If didn't lie about being overruled on shooting down the confirmed Chinese spy balloon, and with the Liar in Chief that's a big if, who are the traitors that let the commies complete their mission before getting clearance from Xi to shoot it down?
Hey wooden Joey . This is your land- this is my land!
They took pictures of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
You do realize they have satellites that can read a name on a tombstone anywhere in the US.
Hopefully you see this.  Has anyone ever questioned why this balloon was never addressed? Spotted over the White House compliments of their live webcam on November 30th. Also look close to the right of balloon looks like a drone.  I watched it for a while and neither moved.
In a balloon?? You mean to tell me that a balloon is the best technology they have to do this with? I mean, nothing a little more obscure maybe?
Biden needs to pay for this. He needs to be held accountable for his part in allowing this to happen. This is treason
Nato loves war. I don’t believe them.
Guessing there are tons that floated around Hawaii. Pacific Fleet Command Center here… etc.
Good thing we let it float across the country and shot it down just in time
Color me surprised 
If only they wouldn’t have come up with a tricky name like “spy balloon”.
I have a feeling we emp'd that shit way before it hit our coast
When they decide to move it will be swift.
Up to something else
No shit??
And if they know that, then explain why it was allowed to roam across our country for a whole week until it was brought down. Don't answer, we know why! 
It's open season 24/7/365 since the government refuses to protect us.
Oh wow. They just figured that out. Most of us without any type of advanced technological equipment figured that out. So does that mean the Intelligence community is only in name only? Lol Washington has become a fiasco.
What they saw when it flew over any Marine/Army base...
The same Intel that said Russia and trump were colluding? The same Intel that knew sadam had wmd’s?
And we just let it in. Time to arrest people.
After gathering Intelligence on US Military Bases Joe Biden finally decided to take it down
Like we didn’t already know that. Biden failed. General Milley failed. Both are bought and paid for by the CCP. Change my mind.
Open borders Open Skies Police Shortages and Chaos, protect yourself
US Intelligence. Oxymoron.
They won’t tell us the Truth. I’m guessing it was actually our balloon launched from Fairchild, WA as a distraction from Hunter’s involvement with Ukraine Bio Labs and Twitter hearings exposing the FBI
What will the Biden regime do to respond? This is bold aggression.
It’s blatantly apparent our Government is communicating with China and it’s not in American Citizens best interest.
Yup !!
Isn’t the US openly talking about going to war with China by 2025? If so I’m not surprised by these actions.
So does that mean the DOD will now ask for a trillion dollars to counter the damage?
So that’s an act of war
I wouldn’t doubt it if Biden and his regime were in on this entire thing
US intelligence credibility
Well, it's more efficient for he Chinese. They won't waste time using expensive rockets hitting nothing  targets. They now have precise coordinates to hit military facilities the first time. They are getting their $10 billion money's worth.
So, did the Chinese get what they wanted (military intelligence)? That's the real question...
Or, did the "Chinese Spy Balloon" really originate from U.S. intelligence?
The worlds biggest liars are now saying we need to fear balloons.
Fire Joint Chiefs.
China is not our enemy is what I heard …smh
And yet absolutely nothing will be done to China other than a strongly worded letter of condemnation. It’s a joke what freedom loving humanity has become, weak!
And we let it maneuver over several active highly sensitive sites after it was detected. Further, the military claims that they actually know transmissions were blocked are absurd at this point. Unless you are/were in this business you simply do not know how bad this was.
They're planning something big! They are distracting the world with Ukraine,draining countries out of money and military equipment. Now blatantly spying on US, Latin America and other countries as well.
That would explain the same type of balloon being discovered in four other countries.
I'm betting that the next spy balloon will have a "happy face" on it.
Do not allow biden to send any parts back to Chyna
Hope they're still watching. 3 more could be on the way. Or whatever the deal was btwn him and xi
 allowed #CCP military to collect data from #USA military  sites. Good job sleepy. Great job on protecting our borders. Low and high. 
It was spying with a purpose.
Why else would they be flying a balloon loaded with surveillance gear? It’s why we put satellites into orbit
Really? Looks more like an excuse for the military to be able to use deadly force on or above US soil for anything seen to be a national security threat. That was a distraction and for future use cause scenario. Wait till amendment to laws are made. What else happened that week?
Balloon In The Sky from China! Great song, I liked it.
are you sure it's not some evil balloons from russia or china or U.S own?
think the recent spy balloons from china... truth.out...
two more suspects being pursued as I write this... peck and daniels off of pico near same synagogue... if anyone asian is caught I'm thinking cells of commie chinese here to soften us up ahead of major attack and invasion of ccp troops stationed in vancouver since last summer...
This is why shooting down the China balloon was pointless.  China can get any intel they want from our politicians.
What?
Just for you, it's obviously a previously undocumented, highly sophisticated, stealth balloon from China that was designed to operate underwater, and use rust as a camouflage.  I mean come on look at it you can see the similarity! https://t.co/1SiZalL0Fm
🧨Episode 50 is here, Join Brad &amp; Jamie as they recap the Daytona 500, Shooting down balloons, discuss the side by side restart, read reviews from Auto Club &amp; LA motels plus much more! #nascar #NASCAR75 https://t.co/hOMumU1joY
The outstretched hand is nonsense.  From Pelosi’s trip to the continued parading of the US Navy in the South China Sea to the balloon fiasco to the expansion of US military presence in the Philippines… the US Central regime has done nothing but antagonize the CCP.  Then there is… https://t.co/ZtblA7yF3J
This analysis may ruin your day, if you're a Westerner and/or an opponent of Chinese Communists, but America's Suez moment appears to be approaching fast and perhaps cannot be deterred much longer.  Happy Monday
"We don’t what those three objects were, but nothing suggests they were related to China’s spy balloon, or surveillance vehicles from another country,” Joe Biden said. "They were most-likely BALLOONS tied to private companies, recreation, or research institutions”. 🛸🛸🛸 https://t.co/XfIjtd9To3
It's a balloooooooooooooooooon.
Why is calling a virus from China a “Chinese virus” racist, but calling a spy balloon from China a “Chinese spy ballon” isn’t?
And crickets and lies from so-called officials. "So, ya, we got tough and shot down actual balloons 🎈 so stop judging us for letting the China balloon traipse across the USA for a bunch of surveillance photos of our military bases. We are badasses!." Asshats, all of them.
No it wasn't  ordered by biden from china to fly here not balloons drones
The spy balloons from China is definitely a huge red flag for that.
Spy Balloon From China Could Intercept Phone Calls Yet, Biden waited for the balloon to finish its surveillance across America before shooting it down.  https://t.co/QDx9lp38Go
Biden is about to get us into WWIII. There were no wars under Trump, there were no spy balloons from China, there were no invasions into Ukraine.
Difference between Biden and Trump. Biden goes to Kiev to fight for Democracy. Trump goes to Helsinki and crawls up Putin’s ass.
agree - the narrative was STUPID AF
President Biden told the press last Thursday that the US intelligence community has no evidence that the balloons that were recently shot down with $400,000 Raytheon Sidewinder missiles came from a Chinese surveillance program. https://t.co/VLo3JAzpPC
The consequence of balloon incident in the U.S will definitely surpass that of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor! That would lead all hatred toward China!!! #ccp≠chinese   💥Pro-CCP American are not from the White House but from the U.S military! https://t.co/TO5vXPfCeS
The salary cap is a myth, and no one is close to the American military in actual capability. China is a generation ahead of Russia, and Russia is losing to Ukraine using scraps from our military.  And if you listen to the pentagon, we learned more from the balloons than they did.
Yes, because lord knows the people who actually are working to clean it up could benefit so much from his presence.  "You know what we need to help clean up go quicker? A whole cadre of Secret Service agents, reporters and camera operators following an old guy around."
I mean, I get what you’re saying, I couldn’t care any less where he goes, as long as he leaves America’s Wallet at the house. This Ukraine spending is getting absolutely ridiculous, and it weakens our own abilities at a time when China and everyone else is flexing on the US.
I’m interested in knowing why you think the salary cap is a myth. China and Russia are now transferring all their economic activities to each other’s economy, which will eventually spill into each’s Military sector. Them COMBINING military tech ideas is a scary thought.
They have been economically involved for a long time.  Shanghai Cooperative is 21 years old. China funded much of Russia's oil exploration and drilling because the US didn't let them buy oil from other places.  The Chinese air force flies slightly modified MiG's.  Nothing new.
13 dead. 80B in weapons. Ams left behind in Afghanistan. 5 min away from Nwar. Poland asks for Am Troops.$M given to the Biden Fam. Open boarders. Everything cost 2x more. China Balloons. Giving oil to Russia. Ohio. Corrupt president. And your ok w that. America 1st Dude!
Not a single word about China from the Biden Administration, the spy balloon was not Russian.
Why is calling a virus from China a “Chinese virus” racist, but calling a spy balloon from China a “Chinese spy ballon” isn’t?
Forget the telescopes that can see into other galaxies 😂 That would be like viewing a single strand of DNA from your skin from space.....But yeah China has balloons you can see, wonder which is more effective?
All the “intelligence” gathered from the China balloon is being deployed!
Everything old is new again…  Balloon With 3 Hypersonic Missiles Tested by China in 2018                                                                                                                   READ: https://t.co/amASce0HPn
We are america! For all our faults we have many many more great qualities we've done great things as a country and yes all of us have gotten screwed at some point but folks we got balloons from China and were on the verg of nuclear war but everyone's sooo petty!
Fuck you
He's no commander, he's not running the WH. Lack of response and screw-ups for everything from Afghanistan to China balloons to rail disasters, Biden is not in charge. Communication has to be calculated and worked through the Obama surrogates.
I’m sorry to say that I expect Tucker will blame Biden for this, too.
If Biden doesn't respond AGAIN Tucker should blame him!! He's our Commander in Chief.  Is that beyond his call of duty?
Y’all sound very asinine, blaming the president for every little event, There are people put in place within state for a reason including elected officials, you cannot expect the president to be everywhere at once.   Yes the state can request or deny federal help.
Afghanistan and 13 dead serviceman is not "every little event", Chinese spy balloons flying unchallenged over the country is not "every little event".....He's not a commander because he's not commanding...
Those balloons are actually pretty common, mostly used for weather,  and Internet in rural areas.  This isn’t the first time it’s happened, also happened under other administrations.
Totally staged because everyone knows biden is weak and they are trying to save face since he shot down school project balloons with 1/2 million dollar missiles. Because he was trying to save face from letting china float over us for a week and steal our data... shit show.
A Picture is worth 1,000 Dictators:  a) Trump flies into enemy states to salute murderous dictators  b) Biden flies into ally states (Kyiv, Ukraine), who are under attack, as air-raid sirens blare, to support peaceful democracy.
Canadian here. No biss. Do you really believe the air raid sirens weren’t staged? Reporters have said there weren’t any. People are all calmy walking around. Seems sus
Biden shot the balloons down. Trump let them fly. Trump gets $20 million a year from the Bank of China, which rents the 20th floor of the Trump tower in New York.
There is nothing weak about shooting down $200 Pico balloons. That takes skill, a $430,000 Missle of 2 fired from a $210,000,000 Fighter jet flown by a man who has over $1,800,000 in training.  Better luck next time as China is quick to create NextGen Balloons. https://t.co/Mr6S1Yg2ll
Stephen, our president shot down a child's balloon with a Sidewinder heat-seeking missile.  Not a surveillance balloon from China.  C'mon, buddy
Nice job, Joe Biden
So when he didn’t shoot down the first one quickly enough you were all calling for heads to roll and now this?
Biden is using Ukraine as a diversion from his lame response to China. The CCP owns him. Biden is trying to look tough in Ukraine to keep us from looking at his failure to hold China accountable for spreading COVID, stealing our technology and flying spy balloons above us.
BREAKING: Biden makes surprise visit to war-torn Ukraine, promises more aid: ’World stands with you’ | Just The News
Balloons are only from china...thats the  best china has..
US military conducted at least 600 reconnaissance aircraft sorties to spy on China in South China Sea in 2022, including using balloons and disguising its aircraft as civilian planes, a Chinese intelligence firm revealed.
If we took half the time and money that we spent on harmless balloons and spent it on finding real harmful ingredients that make it possible to create drugs that kill people daily here that come from China... then would we be smart?
The USA will become the center of World War 3 because the USA lies between China and Russia. The US is already surrounded by Russia and China. You can see on the map where China's test balloons come from to see how quickly the United States Defense can react.
China must have threatened to take the Biden crime family off of the payroll. See how quickly it went from, the military tracking the balloons out from China, to some nameless corporations.
Hot air balloons from china don’t come cheap
That’s about what I charge, how about you??
Whew, that almost scared the living s*** out of me, I wonder if we have a way out of this. 1st of all I would suggest that the United States does not apologize for shooting down the balloon from China second of all tell them to take a hike  Here we go https://t.co/3cqh7F7Ooi
So we go from China spy balloons to train wrecks to now blowing up manufacturing plants…all while the US government sends more money to Ukraine…. Ok got it, it’s some wild times out here. 👀
Don't forget WW3!!!! Got to stay up to date on the apocolypse!!
I won’t be here for that, I’ll be gone when rapture happens 
And Biden will be re-elected…. As will Fetterman.  GOP is too busy throwing each other under the bus… and “Standing with Ukraine”
https://t.co/6AfAyIjP2m there is no sattelited in space it’s all balloons didn’t you learn anything from the China scam balloon with sattelites?
NEWS : NASA confirms half-ton meteor crashed in South Texas
Meteors can’t hit earth it’s a lie. Nothing can get in or out trough the firmament.
CCP Spy Device details from last week. From Pentagon: "Could contain a payload inside the Balloon to keep it from being captured."  Middle section was a super high definition Camera. The US Military was tracking it from China. Thanks https://t.co/uEEpeDhRax… https://t.co/VZsC1KXjUu
That is DARPA
What is Darpa? We have proof it was Tracked from China. Please read up if you're going to comment.
If you're trying to say the spy device isn't from china you're lying. or uninformed. Zero evidence for this.
Okay. Lol!
You know I would be screaming that your national security is at risk, I mean do you really think the government does not know what is in the air space? I’m not arguing with you, sir you do not even know what DARPA is! WOW!
Your inability to phrase english doens't mean I don't know what DARPA is.
Yes it is because the virus and vaccine came from China which is flying balloons over our country and had warships with Russia off our Alaskan coast. Do you think Big Pharma cares about health when they can make money? LOL
Florida is warning citizens the Covid Vax can cause heart attacks.   Sweden discards Eight millions doses of Covid Vax.   England has stopped offering the Covid Vax as of 2-12-23.   People are waking up!
U.K. Is not stoping offering the covid-19 vaccine, that is a lie.   They will still be offering the vaccine to everybody over the age of 50, to anyone with underlying medical issues, and to any frontline workers.  Do you ever tell the truth?
Laura has no common sense; those under 50 with no med issues will not be offered Vaccine.
So they're offering a vaccine that they believe is dangerous to their elderly, vulnerable and millions upon millions of peoples with Frontline jobs.  Yeah... That makes a whole lot of common sense!
Didn’t you see the balloons from China? What about Fang Fang? What about Feinstein’s chauffeur? How about the Chinese spies that were expelled? What about all the Chinese that are in our colleges and universities?  Are living under a rock?
CHINA BALLOON 🧐⁉️ Mmmm‼️ The U.S. military lifts the Chinese balloon's 'priority sensors' from the ocean floor https://t.co/nTRRg8waRZ
They’re teaming up, and these balloons are just testing the waters, and allowed to fly over our nuclear sight and strategic places. Four days collecting data, I also heard the one that flew over Alaska was from Russia. China has strategically aligned its ships so they can hit us
Joe Biden spent #PresidentsDay in another country, in a war zone, hand delivering $500m taxpayer dollars to another President.   Who else thinks Biden is a disgrace?
The absolute worst President and human being. His greed and all that he has done to bring this country to its knees. He gave 500million more to Ukraine but never bothered to go to Ohio
Food for Thought-Biden goes to Ukraine but not to the border? Biden gives illegal foreigners 5 star hotel rooms but not to Americans who need to move from dangerous chemicals? Biden gives my money to help a communist Ukraine but ignores communist China's balloons? 2 more years 🤣
Unlike Biden, this guy would’ve blown the balloon up from China when it first took off from China old joe could learn something
TRENDING: Biden lands in Kyiv on surprise visit to Ukraine.  Please write in comments the most realistic caption for this photo..
How. Quite the chutzpah the audacity to assert the special council will protect from trump autocracy. We're there China, balloons, corvettegate, f15 gaffe from biden, free speech, Biden slush funds, Afghanistan,  covid, Obama visit for his painting.
" For the political appointee of the president to investigate and perhaps prosecute Biden’s leading political opponent is, as Garland rightly noted, an “extraordinary circumstance.” And removing any risk of potential taint serves the public interest."
He was completely safe  #Putin would never do anything to stop #Biden from destroying the US &amp; #Ukraine needs him to keep sending money &amp; military equipment,(also key to destroying the US). Anything about classified docs, China's US farmland, Inflation, or spy balloons to report?
Cloak-and-dagger moves accompany rare presidential trip to war zone
Bidens trip to Ukraine was a last minute scheme to try and change the weakness narrative from the China balloon. This administration is willing to risk war with Russia and their counterparts solely for a PR boost.
If Biden can casually visit Ukraine's Royal Palace for a photo op, the war isn't as violent and terrible as they're claiming.
China has expanded their military capabilities in every catagory from missiles to balloons. IDT they will use nukes against us, b/c they need America as a market for thier many wares. They have bought many of the Politicians, and hold ransom over Joe's "business" dealings.
China flying spy balloons across the US, North Korea firing ICBMs, Saudi Arabia looking to price crude away from US dollar, and Russia invading Ukraine - I don’t think America can handle any more international respect for Biden.
Thanks to President Biden, the United States is once again a leader on the global stage, and not a laughingstock.
It's the balloons from China.
Today while I was streaming, I brought up a random basketball player namedMarshall Henderson. I have never once talked about him before. I go onto TikTok &amp; a random highlight reel of his pops up lol
Just like you stopped the China spy balloon from Traversing the US?
If Republicans in Congress try to take away people’s health care, increase costs for middle-class families, or push more Americans into poverty,   I will stop them.
And US lost in vietnam war due to Chinese forces at the time thats why US not happy with China till this day  And accusing many spying balloons from China just to divert attention from Nordstream
The US lost in Vietnam due to a lot of factors, most people in this country today were not even alive to see it. The US population sees a competitor in China, and has chosen to treat it as such. Most simply do not care if we blew up Nordstream - it was a prudent maneuver.
Nobody trying to attack US , it absurd for US to feel the threat from China   Most simply do not care if we blew up NS - true  the general EU population just havent aware of US tactics for NS. If they know, why would they protest for less wages / late retirement?  Its a given...
China is a threat in an economic and strategic sense - there is no disputing that. If China invades Taiwan, there will be WWIII. With that said - blowing up NS was absolutely necessary to guarantee the economic destruction of the Russian petro industry.
If China invade Taiwan why WWIII ?? Is Tai US territory? Why the difference between Ukr and Tai?  The difference is US feels the military Threat from Chna and want to control the sea territory to limit China military When China invade Tai it will be US excuse to invade China
The difference lies in the long-term security guarantees that the US has made and the vested US interests that lie there.
How come there is no security garentee for Ukr ? Why the difference?  Now chip buiding is gonna happen in US what else of  Vested US interest do Tai hold for US? An excuse to strike China and maintain defensive line for US
Are you kidding? It will take over 3T of investment to even come close to what TSMC has on Taiwan.  Ukraine and the US do not have the same longstanding agreements and frankly, Whataboutism is the weakest form of discourse.
Sure Ukr and US doesnt have longstanding agreement but they would make one, especially when intelligence sighted possible invasion Why so bother with the chips cause advance military need those chips. Regular computer dont need those Why US feels the threat China will attack?
LOL!!!!!! Are you seriously that delusional? Every single device in manufacture uses those chips. China has made its intention to attack Taiwan clear, period.
No China said it will only attack when Tai depends independence and represent real China which recognize China as illegitimate In other words nobody is attacking Tai and US already feel the threat and will use Tai as excuse to make pre emptive strike as well as possible ww3
This just showed only when there is vested interest for US, US will attack. US forgot about the taliban already? Why retreat when they are stripping womens right ? Cause theres no $$ interest for US
For somebody who claims to be educated, you clearly have no concept of what you are talking about. The US left because we had no support there - the moment that we stopped fighting their war for them, the Taliban took over. That is the major diff between Afghanistan and Ukraine.
But US is #1 ?? Why retreat from Taliban.  What kind of military support do US need? The US left because theres no $$ interest in there That explains the difference bw Tai, Ukr, Talib. US loves war cause they benefits from it When there is no benefit they out asap
Ok, let me spell this out for you since you seem incapable. No matter how much money the US spends or how many weapons we send - if a nation is unwilling to defend itself, it is all for naught. We have no business in nation-building.
Ok, let me spell this out for you since you seem incapable. US have no interest in nation building at all, this includes everywhere except US US will only spend money on things that suit them such as gaining $ or destroying enemy $ / military When theres nothing they out
Afghanistan was a perfect example of the sunk cost fallacy, people spent decades trying to recover that dumpster fire - in part because of the lives lost there, or due to the treasure invested - we should have walked away from it 18 years earlier.
Why US send many batches of weapons to Ukr? Cause they dont want war to end soon Donald T said he would stop the war and yet this admin coninues with that why? Cause it crumple R military and economy Why wait till a year to send tanks? Cause they want a prolonged war
Thank god!  Protection from #China balloons arrives for Dem #progressive stronghold #Madison!  Thank you  https://t.co/NjYTwqLRUn
Hey Biden .. you and your damn FED causing US markets struggling/stink big time huh?? What’s for ?? Any illegals trading from your son or you ?? Did you tell China to throw some balloons??
President Zelenskyy and all Ukrainians remind the world every day what courage is.  They remind us that freedom is priceless.  And worth fighting for.  For as long as it takes.
MILLIONS already died from a virus developed in CHINA and a balloon ( one of several ) was allowed to fly over this country before Biden acted. A highly spreadable virus could have easily been deposited in our country and China would have never had to fire a shot.
Oh that’s funny! 😆🤣🤣 https://t.co/mFoMGaJVur
He's literally shot down Amateur balloons the last two weeks while allowing the CCP to fly a spy balloon over the US. All he did was Piggyback off Lighthizer's trade deals &amp; just ban US manufacturers from selling chips to China. And blew up the Nordstrean 2.   Dude's a failure
Joe Biden refused to do an interview with Fox for the Super Bowl.   And today he's in Ukraine, in his aviators, in a war zone, indifferent to an air raid siren.    Conservatives are losing their minds.  And I'll say it again: I underestimated Joe Biden.
Joe Biden hasn’t stopped serving the American people since he took office. Seriously, the man never stops. He is a true leader and his accomplishments are huge.  I don’t know why people are worried about his age. He’s got energy to burn.
He's done literally nothing
He shat all over china’s microchip industry and destroyed our 2nd largest geopolitical foe’s army without a drop of American blood and for a fraction of the price. You people have no idea what you’re talking about and it’s frankly sad. Zero original thought in your head.
Spy Balloon From China Could Intercept Phone Calls  https://t.co/qrMNNp9COC
So American infrastructure is being destroyed from within and the news isn't even covering it. China owns US and its only a matter of time before full collapse. Heck they couldn't even knock down a balloons with a half million dollar missile
You’re laughing about the military shooting down a spy balloon from China. Would all of you ignorant MFs still be laughing if it was a China airplane over Pearl Harbor. MORONS
It was tracked from China for the fourth time. It looks nothing like the Balloons Darpa uses. It's possible, but what does that have to do with them using them on us? Are you saying they get to spy on us? Sounds like you sympathize with China.  If it was one of ours they wouldn't…
Ok. Where is your proof? We have proof of the Chinese spy Ballon. Do you support the CCP?
It is warfare on the human race! In the form of bio weapons; in shots &amp; those balloons from China.   I cannot help to notice all the TOXIC SPILLS at the same time-those 1% Bas TURDS are harming, maiming: giving us quick &amp; slow deaths,  mixing it up -so u cannot make sense of it!
5th Generation warfare means - you don’t know who the enemy is  Is it Schwab?  Is it Fauci? No there is some entity mich bigger than them running this, who is it?  Dr Malone   #Globalists #Covid #vaccine #Globalcoup
Trump did that while Joe was getting money from China….much like he did for that balloon per mile
😂😂😂. I’ve never listened to Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, but I do know the chorus.  “Balloon In The Sky From China” great line!😂😂😂😂😂
And many more. Like Biden sleeping with China, swalwell literally sleeping with China. And still having a damn gov job. Them letting a balloon from China fly over our entire country. Them letting China buy American farmland, the list of tyranny is super deep with dems.
Joe Biden promise China let that balloon go across America if China would buy Hunter Biden’s paintings for $500,000 each the IRS in the FBI need to check where that money came from for those paintings
We all still laugh at the reruns of "The Andy Griffith Show," but to think that it mirrors the strategy of the Biden administration is quite terrifying:
Of course you’re comfortable with Trump the …
This comment is nonsense. The Chinese balloon was an act of war. What would China do if we sent a balloon over China launched from a neighboring country?
It's speculated the balloons from China were a dry run for EMPs.
History-less young folks are aging farther and farther away from the lessons of WWII.  The lesson we are currently struggling over is appeasement.  Hitler said he would have given on Poland had the west shown more resistance than 'the Phony War.'
As long as bidens in WH, WW3 is a possibility.
Russia abandoning the New START treaty is a bad sign.  The original START left Russia configured for first strike.  They are prepared to win; we have no preparation for strikes on urban centers at all.
We are in a position of nearly prepared at all times. Our military is still the most powerful on earth.
And our grid is weak as ever don’t expect to be invaded first. Expect a emp
🚨BREAKING NEWS... Newly released photo from DOD of pilot flying ABOVE the Chinese balloon over central U.S. While the top flying altitude of the F-22 Raptor is CLASSIFIED this tell us it flies HIGH 65-70,000+ feet since it's flying ABOVE the #balloon. #SpyBalloon #China https://t.co/zF0DdvGPdx
FYI...this particular plane is a U-2 surveillance/spy plane, but of course the F-22s were up, too (they ultimately shot it down.)
Everything going up in price, ufos being shot out of the sky, china spy balloons, poisonous chemicals being spilled in Ohio and now super pigs from Canada making their way down south to the US. When does the madness end!!
2/19/2023 Miles Guo: The West will not fight a war in China because of two fatal issues; from the balloon incident, the West has truly realized that their threat comes from the CCP, rather than Chinese Laobaixing.

Biden has Iran China and Russia forming a pack against the USA ! COVID came from China , spy balloons come from China ! Biden corrupt money came from China !
I also want to know what happens when US balloons go over China, as they have said 10 have been recently.  We launch ours from Sweden and the jet stream from there, goes right over China or Russia. #ChinaSpyBalloon
The Panamax Post from   https://t.co/gP6np7nkqk  #supplychain #container #tanker #ships #China #balloon #mariners  thanks  great video

They have so many classified documents from several locals &amp; garage&gt;To get your mind off of that they allowed some balloons up in the air. Now, do you hear anymore about those classified documents? Or his AF2 5X flights W/ HUNTER China &amp; Ukraine on our Tax$$? https://t.co/wEpWQwJYdZ
THE BIG GUY | WHO IS HE? CONGRESS WANTS TO KNOW | Just The News
Well if they could get the documents that were found at old joes homes, I’m sure they would see exactly what’s going on…. Any word on if they will ever get those?
No idea if real, but supposed to be from an overflight of the China Balloon. https://t.co/MEumZ6tUP3
Interesting
Looks like a U2 spy plane wing and I think they did do reconnaissance on the ballon with one.
Don’t be fooled, this was on purpose, just like letting the balloons fly over and train derailments. You’re under attack from the inside.
They need to impeach this entire administration For treason

Bingo!
We’re they running Windows Server??
Yes the Azure.
That sure makes me feel safe about companies that use Azure backends. What companies should I be cautious with?
Fuck classification, it’s time we know what the government knows. After all, they already spilled out most important “secrets”.
It's either incompetence or treason. Either way fire them all.
Conveniently timed for when Biden allowed the Chinese spy balloon to traverse the entire continental US.
China has hundreds of satellites constantly monitoring everything we do. They don't need balloons or TikTok.
True. But TikTok is cheap data gathering as well as expansive &amp; effective social engineering targeted at our youth. Great place to start when subverting a country.
china is probly the rare country that can break away from middle income trap, their industries has matured &amp; moved upstream, downstream production is moving to southeast asia, one of hubby's chinese ex-colleague just met up to discuss buying a factory here to manufacture parts
How can this be anything but a massive positive indicator?
Not sure if my interpretation is accurate but it’s quite unexpected that not only did US sanctions on China not critically impair her development, but SEA nations benefited too (eg see the FDI flowing into Penang plus your example) 
The U.S. is using Westphalian tools in a civilisational contest. Civilisation - productivity, knowledge, culture - just flows around silly obstacles.

BS.. #Chinajoe has already received billions from CCP. He is &amp; always has been compromised/corrupted. Why do you think the China balloon was allowed to cut across the US? They knew what it was &amp; could/should have shot it down in the Alaska waters.They were hoping no one noticed.
Personally proud of the dude for actually being a strong supporter of democracy and not completely worshipping (see dick sucking) Putin and Kim Jong Il… other strong men, etc etc like tRump
Do you really think Joe Biden is making decisions in real time on when to shoot down foreign objects? We have a chain of command. It’s not like it was a nuclear rocket… this is y GOP will never fully go away cuz they prey on crack pots like you. Good grief…
Oh really...  So who DID decide to let it continue on it's surveillance across the nation?? We need names.. Good grief..
You can’t call BS and have zero proof… we all watched tRump apologize and cower at Putins feet and rub elbows with Kim Jong Il, one of these things is not like the other…
Meantime, Einstein's pedo clients walk free, Pedo Joe's criminal connections to China and Russia are ignored, trains derailing, balloons from china, plants going up in flames, etc etc. But Trump
Maybe those were weather balloons from China that manipulated this cross country storm to happen.
Because bad weather has never happened before.   I guess this PSA is for your illegal alien friends.
Hmmm. We didn’t have winter storms until AFTER the Chinese spy balloons traversed our skies.   Or so it seems.

Who's the genius!? LOL
Houston , we have a problem.
... and even though we are on the brink of WW3, everything costs way more, and we have trains spilling chems all over our country as China looks on from spy balloons, you still think Biden is doing great!
holy fucking shit, the wingnut screech monkeys are melting straight the fuck down today because Joe Biden is really fucking good at his job and it's driving them crazy and I am so fucking here for it. pass the popcorn
You'll find that they scream louder when Democrats and Biden are doing well and having positive feedback from the population. It's an overcompensation and desperate attempt to have the attention drawn back to them.
Wow what world do you live in where has he done anything good for us please show me the proof is all I ask
You should be shown proof in picture form for everything and would say it's all fake like the typical trump cult member. No one owes you anything
The trains that trump deregulated, the 3 balloons that flew over under trump which he did nothing about and then hid from the public, the inflation that came in part from the 25% increase in debt that trump added. Damn that Biden.
So anyway there is all 3 points tackled. Trump did not have anything to do with the train in Ohio, did not hide spy baloons, and we'll see who comes out on top in dept raise (Trump at 33%, Obama over 70%, Biden after his term ?) Keep up the 3d prints! I 3D model too.
They are all crooks I just think it's amusing when people lump it all on one person like they created all the issues in 2 years but won't acknowledge the part the last played in it. (not saying you do it).
Fair enough and I agree. Have a good day.
Sure it's not them balloons from China causing it???

Wake up. That’s where we’re headed because of this feckless administration.
Alas, there is a huge gap between headed and imminent, however.
Trump causes internal chaos, like ending safety precautions that caused the East Palestine disaster.
It had nothing to do with breaks LMAO
No, no, no! It is the harbinger of death, dear. Please follow the hashtag #diedsuddenly or #diedsuddenlynews. The truth is there for you.
If the vaccine is as deadly as you say, why aren't we seeing more deaths?

Hello Trump,if you see this tweet lets play Fortnite
Cuban Missile Crisis, Able Archer. Do some research.
Awesome policy speech .
This can't be a real quote. Let's say it is. How is he going to do that, Mr. Producer? Just last night Mark Livin was pro defending Ukraine and militarily defeating Russia.  MAGA is sending mixed messages. Which one is it? War or Peace?
go away. never show up on my feed again
I find it bizarre he chooses to avoid blaming the person that actually started the war by blaming his own country. 
he has significantly aged. can't they ALL just go quietly into the sunset and enjoy retirement?
Absolutely
Agree
You’re a loser
“Ww3 will happen unless you vote for me” pretty desperate
He is the weakest president we've had in my lifetime.  He blusters and lies, lies, lies. He would've given Ukraine over to Putin on a platter. I can't wait till he's not around anymore.
It's not III. Its IV
Yeah it's been "closer than ever" for over a year. WWIII didn't happen after the Cuban missile crisis, it sure as hell isn't happening now.
Honestly this is a winning platform.
All I hear is argle bargle.
Ah yes.... peace.
Yes IRS Also
What is peace through strength, my friend?
Indeed, it's true that when Trump was president, there wasn't such a cloud of war.
Shit....I agree with all of this. Dammit, I feel dirty. lol

1st of, damn he looking slim, been a while since i last saw him. I also agree with a lot of his message, but I also think that he needs to grow beyond his tactics of 2016, i hope to see that growth. Because so far i'm not sure about him. Hope there won't be a war with DeSantis.
World War III was trending every week when Donald Trump was President.
Americans! Do not die for Joe!
He’s all for peace….as ling as he’s able to steal money from everyone.  War is bad for his grift.
Give peace through strength a chance again.
we gotta get thru another major stock market crash (1929 level) before we get to "ww3"..  so you have time to prepare.. no need to get all panicky now

Why won’t Republicans ask Putin to end thr war by leaving the Ukraine?
Boy they really had to hit the guy with the lighting from a bad Mexican restaurant....he must look like the under side of an orangutans scrotum.
I miss not having him as out President.  He was a peacemaker, and never got us close to war. Promises made. Promises kept.  We Love Trump!
Totally agree
GROSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS He has nothing to do with peace. He's just a lot of drama.
Focus must be on coming to a peace agreement.. not blowing the trumpets of war.
As much as I don’t really care for him, he’s not wrong we didn’t have any of these problems under his presidency
we say this every month
make sure we get that phone number in there to text so we can get those donations flowing
Charlatan
Trump is like a evil villain who loves  hear himself monologuing
Watch him with no volume to distract. It seems like he's in pain/on the verge of tears. I'm wondering if someone is propping him up, telling him to read what's on the script. Similar to what they're probably doing with Biden. Damn, is it too much to ask for a president under 60?
WIII will not happen.
I truly believe this
World needs him right now not just America 
Fear-mongering for fun and profit. If only Trump University hadn't been such an obvious scam, he could have lectured there on this subject, because he's an expert
Man, I wish Washington, LIncoln and Roosevelt hadn't gotten America involved in the War of Independence, The Civil War and World War 2.  Imagine how much better off this country would be if they just...refused to get involved.
Trump is right again!
Shame the world won't be here in a few days for President Trump to solve our current issues. Take a good look around one last time.
Trump nailed it with that speech
WWIII is here NOW.
Gen Z is gonna learn a hard lesson about supporting the current thing
Imagine if we had him in UK what do we have sunak  
The thing is he is always right
I agree with Trump.  It takes 96 seconds for launches from Russia and China to start landing in the US.  That is an end-of-life scenario.

World War III is literally always closer than it was before now. That’s how time works.
Not entirely true. Trump's administration sanctioned Nord Stream and provided Ukraine with hundreds of stingers, javelins, howitzers and half a $billion every year. The SMO could have been prevented if Minsk accords were implemented, unfortunately Trump was no ally on that front.

When you side with the bad guys causing issues and give up all concessions like a coward,  conflicts are avoided. Not something to brag about
But campaigning on WW3? How could this be a good look?? #PresidentTrump needs to Promise Peace through Strength - to RESTORE peace and shut down the warmongering globalists.
Why didn't he get rid of all those agencies when he was the President? Why did he appoint corrupt leads and heads of agencies? Asking for a friend
Get some trump / Putin

I don’t know how even people who hate trump could argue his point here. His 4 years of peace speak for itself.
Lolol at people still falling for this  in 2023
You were scared Donald
'peace through strength' is no alternative whatsoever
Trump will just let Putin annex Ukraine and invade Eastern Europe. That's not peace at all.
As always, he's right.
I all but guarantee you a Trump win in 2024. I’m not even a Trump supporter but he’s the strongest candidate out there currently . Despite being polarizing he’s the only one able to articulate a “vision”. It may be unpalatable to some but it’s not the usual political double talk
NATO kept pushing hard despite Warsaw Pact dismantling promise.
Get ready libatards. Put your pronouns on and head towards the troop carrier. Good luck and may saint George be with you.
OMG! You actually believe the nonsense that spews from its mouth?
DUDE, YOU RULE!
He’s NOT President. Thank God!!!!
Pffft. This is garbage. Stop watching #FoxNews
WATCH THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!
YES! YES! YES!
Peace through fascism. No thanks Mr. 2020 Loser.
まあ、そうでしょうね。
Someone is about to be indicted.
Love Trump. But if this is truly what he believes WHY is he still associating himaelf with Lindsay Graham, one of the top globalist warmongers?! He has to get back those out of his circle to keep people like me to keep supporting him.
Because Trump was willing to capitulate to world dictators like Putin. There's no need for war if you just give Putin what he wants, which was Trump's MO.
Peace to trump is a Ukraine under Russian control
We are at increased danger of WW-III. NATO had its purpose after WW-II in curbing aggressions of the Soviet Union, but Russia in no longer that. NATO is perceived as an enemy by Russia and the invasion of Ukraine is an act of self-preservation, good or bad. We are feeding a fire.
Yes, it's all for their personal pockets of money to sell their products for warring.  Easy to see.  And, they don't have to die to do it.
Peace sounds good to me!
Maybe. But it is still far off.
We need to do something right now, 2024 will be way too late. It's beyond time to take down this current illegitimate communist administration.
America First 
Bull crap 
Pure Russian Propaganda!
Trump was right,  swamp is deep, an full of elites taking away your rights. Your lives, your children's lives. This swamp is world wide.
Sheesh, there are some warmongers in these comments...people with plenty of TDS, I'm sure. Can't see clearly anymore.
I love you, President Trump.
#BringBackMeanTweets #OrangeManWasRight
Wohhh He is sooo right bloody  My 5 yrs telling us this man threat ignorant etc Look at him ,how is proving to be sane one in all the insanity of USA puppet politicians, arrogant military estab &amp; corrupt biased media  next buy CNN  leaks
That's my President. #PeaceThroughStrength
Same bullshit he said in 2016. It took 78 whole days for the Deep State to get Trump under their control and march forward with the program.
Why is this dummy right 
Trump is the GOAT. This would not be happening if they didn’t steal the election!
lol you bombed people also. you are just as culpable as everyone else. stop trying to be something you arent. you are just here for the attention. you are a narcissistic freakshow.
He probably thought the balloons from China were for him.
He’s 100% right. He did this himself when he was president and he would have no problem doing it again. I don’t think we can say the same about the current occupant of the White House!
From the beginning of the #UkraineRussianWar said it wouldn’t have happened if Trump was still in office.  North Korea wouldn’t be acting out. China wouldn’t have released spy balloons. And talk of World War III?  It’d still be only in Hollywood.  When’s the next U.S. election?
Trump, he's the Man !
You're a joke lady leave the important stuff to the people who understand them. You don't, trump doesn't.
Another deluded dictator
When #Trump was in office, #Russia had already invaded #Ukraine in 2014, you know…
This is the idiot who did the backdoor deal with the Taleban and told them we would be leaving, setting the stage for the self-fulfilled prophecy.
PUTIN/ TRUMP 2024 and BEYOND!!
She should watch Putin’s speech. You can hate him but he laid it out pretty clearly.  I mean, he let a balloon from China cross the entire country 😂
lol, he misinterpreted the graph, it's us imports from china per CHINA's gdp, NOT US GDP 🤣😂, that would be an entirely different graph,  from us gov site 👇 https://t.co/33l7VdWJy9
Nah they're just buying from China instead, you know that other enormous landmass in the east? You popped one of their balloons with a half million dollar missile.
Russia is paying the price for its abuses in Ukraine.   We imposed the largest sanctions ever on a major economy – and we’ll be announcing more this week.   We will hold those responsible for this war accountable – and seek justice for crimes against humanity.
Isn't it quite obvious hush money because the scandal with his son and him and his family what do you think he hesitate to react to the balloons from China they have dirt on him also and his family like and paying so much to Ukraine hush money🤔🇺🇲😎
While our border is being invaded and Ohio residents await real help in the toxic chemical wasteland they call home, Biden heads to Ukraine with a rallying cry and gives them half a billion dollars? Is he nuts or is there something else going on here?
Joe Biden visiting Ukraine is a slap in the face to every American, especially the people of East Palestine, Ohio.  Ukraine is not our friend, and Russia is not our enemy.
Russian asset says what?
I suspect he's less a Russian asset than a Russian tool. Moscow has long found utility in ethical ghouls.
You are another #GOPkompromat
You soopa-doopa crazy. Russian doopa.
God bless centuries of Americans who fought for liberty and democracy. I don't know WTF you stand for.
Fuck your Putin-kissing ass, traitor. #DestroyTheGOP
so almost had it right.. everyone in leadership should have to pass a competency test. can't believe you are a lawmaker lol.
You used to be a dentist. Who the heck would let you into their mouth?
Can't think of a better way for him to showcase American values!
Russian Asset says what?
Bet you would have wanted us to back out of WW2.  Pathetic.
In ww 2 we got involved because Japan attacked us
Yes. But before that Americans turned their back on the war and Hitler was winning.
Russia defeated Germany
with Billions of US dollars support from the US, yes.
It’s almost like you being a traitor to our country that’s a slap in the face of every veteran who ever served in the military.
Reciprocated because of your handle.
Do you see how efficiently MAGA uses the US supporting its allies in Europe and standing up to Putin as a wedge to campaign against Biden? Do you see how closely aligned trump and Putin’s interests are? And how they have been since putin illegally helped trump take power in 2016?
have you seen a surge of neo-nazis supporting Azov? Especially their are people who deny that Azov didn't start out as a neo-nazi group and that they're not using a mirrored wolfsangel?
*There  I cant type when I am mentally fatigued lol
Paul Gosar supports genocide
Americans generally support genocide and we know the American Government does.
Go away Kremlin troll
It’s no longer news that Putin has seats in US Congress, but we see you, Comrade.
Yet... one of your own, Mitch McConnell tells a German audience that Republican leaders support aid to Ukraine: ‘Don’t look at Twitter’, meaning don't look at people like you, a Putin apologist!  How much have you benefited from Russian oligarchs so far?
#blueanon says what?
AMEN!!
RIGHT!!
Is there anyway this is a real person?
Paul, during the Cold War we stood up to Russian bullying. You don't stop bullies by appeasing them, you have to stand firm.
Gosar... Poor guy just has no compass.
So you basically forgot about the Cold War then. 
Actually, Ukraine is our friend and Russia is more of an enemy than a friend. You are not my dentist or congressman. Feel free to go to East Palestine and toss Handiwipes if you want to look presidential.
Fix it.
Since your family has disowned you I guess Putin will also give you a summer home on the Black Sea for supporting him.
You are a Russian asset and traitor.
Oh Okkk goZer
There's a special place in Moscow for you, #traitor.
Putin is a former KGB assassin, who still has people killed. He's a dictator, a warmonger. He has NEVER, EVER been a friend to America. Ukraine is a Republic being invaded by a larger country. You are a liar, &amp; a cheat. If you like dictators &amp; murderers you should move to Russia.
CHA-CING! RUBLES IN THE MAIL!
Gosar pledges allegiance to Putin and Russia. He shud move there.
This needs to be shouted from the rooftops:  Ukraine is not our friend, and Russia is not our enemy!
YOU are the enemy, traitor.   Russia, too. But then you are one and the same, aren't you, tovarisch?
You need help with that airline ticket to Russia?
We asked Ukraine to give up their nukes, they did.  We had a cold war over nukes with Russia, and Putin just said that he wants to go back to it.  Ukraine said they wanted to be a sovereign nation, we agree with them, and Putin invaded them.  Your loyalties are backward here.
Paul Gosar, do you know what a traitor is?  Your family does.  The country does too.
Why don't you move to Russia, you fascist!
Are you saving him a plot of land?
Why don’t you stay in your own lane and be that fifth doctor who doesn’t like toothpaste because he’s a crooked dentist who needs to get his license revoked.
Correct! We need to raise America's Ukraine literacy with Oliver Stone's film "Ukraine on Fire":
Wow!!!  As a U.S. Veteran, I find your statement fascinating!  Do you have your next home picked out too??
Holy smokes Paul Gosar is admitting to being a Russian asset and aiding the enemy.  RESIGN.
If Trump were still POTUS, Ukraine would now be called Russia.
Traitor
Russia is ABSOLUTELY the enemy, you Putin apologist. As one of your constituents with a friend who has family in Ukraine, this is deeply offensive
Nah, that’s you. Russia IS our enemy and has ALWAYS been our enemy. YOU are a TRAITOR to America.
Shame on you! You should resign. Loving Russia and Putin is not a good look for a US Congressman!
So you approve of Russians raping and murdering children?    
You should be expelled from Congress, stripped of your citizenship and deported back to the Motherland. This is what happens to traitors.
Children as young as FOUR have been raped and tortured by Russian soldiers, UN war crimes probe find, as former detainees describe beatings, electric shocks and forced nudity in detention camps&nbsp;  Does this make you proud, Paul?
As someone who lives closer than I'd like to the #ohiotrainderailment I speak for my family. We are proud President Biden is supporting Ukraine. We know the administration is now involved and we watched fumble the crisis. You traitor, do not speak for us.
Is it because they’re Christian and White Paul?…if not, what is it about Russia for you guys?
Ukraine is our friend. Russia has been our enemy forever. How old are you? Russia is the enemy of the United States of America. You'd be wise to remember that. If you don't agree I'm sure you can board a plane for Moscow.
I am so old I remember when the stood up for American democracy and fought Russia. The good old days. #RussiaIsATerroristState
As a US Air Force Veteran and an American Citizen that has served in different capacities working for the Federal Government, I am disgusted, shocked and appalled that you have the audacity to even write something like this.  Russia is absolutely our enemy.
I saw a video the other day of Putin greeting a small child. He knelt to her level, was a foot away, and never touched her after shaking her hand. Can’t say the same for Biden. 
You are an embarrassment to Arizona and a TRAITOR to our country.
He added that last line so that you know he’s a Russian stooge. Like there was any doubt.
Who else is noticing Republicans politicians spewing Vladimir Putin talking points all over Twitter ?  They've must of received their Kremlin payments over the weekend.
Exactly what a pro-Putin fascist would say.  If you have a problem with it, move to Russia .
Your words are a slap in the face of everyone who fights for liberty against tyranny.  Your words are a total disgrace.
You seem upset, Comrade.
I can't wait until you are indicted, Comrade Seditious Traitor to America.   I'd like to see you in Gitmo, rather than Florence.
Do Elle, Gaston, and&nbsp;Isabelle support your defending Putin who allows children to be raped and murdered, Paul?   What if this happened to your 2 granddaughters?   Why in the world would you think this is okay?
People in Az 9th district, that’s you in Flagstaff, Prescott Valley, Scottsdale, Kingman, Lake Havasu, and Tempe. You are represented by a traitor to the US. Please do better in 2024
You a slap in the face, your a traitor to this country. You got problems with Ohio, talk to your buddy Trump, he killed railroad regulation along with you republicans including you. We wanted safety, republicans did not, this is what you get.
Why did you ask for a pardon, Paul? , can we get an investigation into current members of Congress involvement in Jan 6 insurrection please
So glad you are bringing the traitors out in public. You are making it very easy to see who hates America as much as you do!
Good job telling us who you are.
You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor. You are a traitor.
The governor of Ohio rejected help. So, go screw  yourself Gosar, you traitor. Turn yourself in, save Jack Smith time and money.
What if this was one of your granddaughters, Paul?
Your family hates you, you are clearly cognitively impaired as well as a Russian asset. You are a traitor and an insurrectionist and have no business in government. You need to be expelled.
How dare you say Russia is not our enemy!  You’re not even hiding your loyalty to Putin. What a disgusting traitor! Hey  you watching this guy???
You are a treasonous traitor.  Russia and Putin are our number one enemy and the world's.  He has committed crimes against humanity. Another Hitler. Your support of him means you are a racist, white supremacist and traitor to our country.
You're a choas agent for Putin SIT DOWN
THIS is a slap in the face of every American! 
We believe you're horrible. Stop trying to convince us!
You are not an American nor any sort of “patriot” unless you count your fidelity to Vlad. #GOPTraitorsToDemocracy
Remember when Republicans were ANTI-Communist?
Sure Comrade.
Very well said, I would go so far as to say that ukraine is OUR ENEMY.
You’re a treasonous traitor.
Speak for yourself and the other fascists.
Trump did not go when there were derailments in Washington and PA. Looks like you are the actual commie.
What exactly makes Russia our friend? You people are strangely in thrall to authoritarians. Why?
Russia is not our friend, bro  It’s just your sugar daddy
Rep. Paul Gosar's sister called him a 'sociopath' over a violent anime clip edited to show him attacking AOC
Biden offered immediate federal support in Ohio,  their republican governor initially refused it. That was the slap in the face.
That’s PRESIDENT to you, you #Traitor; and it’s YOUR Tweet that is a slap in the face of every DEMOCRACY-LOVING American! #SlavaUkraïni!  Ukraine IS our friend; and Russia IS our ENEMY, KOMRADE! #TraitorPaulGosar!
is pro-Kremlin. He reports to Putin.
Statements such as these are why Republicans will lose in 2024.  Why don’t you just come out and say it republicans hate democracy.  They prove it every day.
Selective memory loss
And once again you are wrong
Ukraine is an ally and a prospective member of NATO, and its people are fighting for democracy and freedom against the forces of autocracy.  Those same ideals founded and still guide the United States. If you don't like them, you're free to leave.
A slap in the face is a member of congress who goes against the oath
So go live in Russia, traitor
Democracy first
Ok komrade traitor.
You don’t belong in our government. Go to Russia
Russia is very much our enemy .. just not yours Gosar
i cant retweet this enough!
It was an awesome trip!!
Russia is our enemy and Ukraine is our friend. Why don’t you move to Moscow — given how much you hate most Americans, it would suit you.
Friends,  Do you ever wonder why so many Republicans who defend Putin are also Qanon fans?  Gosar, BOOBert, MTG-Q, Flynn, et al. I'm convinced Qanon is a creation of Russian intelligence and their Internet Research Agency. It fits their methodology and goals perfectly.
Says the guy who asked for a pardon after Jan 6th.
Wow . You are really a traitor . Russia not our enemy ?  They are literally - with China - are biggest enemies and always trying to ruin our Democracy. How the hell did you get elected ? Wow .
Get after those RR industry reforms there Paully. Betcha won’t.
I don’t get it.   Unless you are on the beneficial end of their payroll or propaganda, It’s difficult to think you don’t understand that Russia is absolutely our enemy.
Finally found the 1 out of 10 dentist and I'm not referring to your toothpaste recommendations...
Hisar is a traitor
Okay, comrade.
You Sir, are on the wrong side of history.
Traitor
Coward
Bro .... please log out.
Says the racist nazi that supports corporate poison.
Hey Paul. What’s the $$ amount you get from Putin to carry his torch
Sorry dude, Biden is a hero around the world right now, you know that, right? Putin IS our enemy...why do you prefer dictators?
But you sure are.
Spoken like a true communist.
You're an damn traitor! #GOPTraitorsToDemocracy
Says another seditionist who, like your leader, is a Putin fan.
omfg, what tf i just read. a traitor. get him and get him quick.
Traitor
Ukraine IS our  friend and Putin’s Russia IS our enemy.
Move to Russia comrade
Ukraine IS our friend and Russia IS our enemy.   And you, Paul, are also an enemy to this country, because you participated in a coup to overthrow our government.
You are a traitor to this country, and Russia is not our ally. The slap in the face to every American is how you supported an insurrection and are still in Congress. Hopefully, Jack Smith has plans to deal with the likes of you.
You're not very good at this
Thank you President Biden!  Gosar- Russia IS our enemy!
China Has Tested Spy Balloons for Maritime Surveillance In 2015, a Kuang-Chi ‘Cloud’ blimp acquired data from more than 2,000 ships in the South China Sea. #Asia #Africa #Europe #America #Maritime #Balloon https://t.co/NA0AKkXUnf
It's a ocean balloon from China 🤣
JUST IN: A sphere 1.5 meters in diameter has washed up on the shores of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.   Local police have closed the beach; object is being looked at by specialists.
You mean the spy balloon from China?
But they're only weather balloons. And hapless refugees from China seeking a better life. Sure they are.
New type of balloon from China?
Mystery sphere found on beach perplexes Japan
Chinese state media have accused the United States of conducting reconnaissance against China using spy planes and balloons, responding to similar allegations from Washington  https://t.co/d9yZPCl79x
Sounds like Russian influence in this accusation. Just accuse others of what you’re already doing.
Nananana...
Counterpoint: Russia is not our friend. Has never been, and never will be a friend. The most they've ever been was an enemy with a bigger enemy in common. They've lurched from Monarchy to Communism to Kleptocracy. Gosar is traitorous trash and should be expelled.
US had a pretty good relationship with the Russian Empire and was even allied with the Soviet Union at some point in history.  And with the fall of the Soviet Union and Russia stopping being communist, there was literally zero reason for US and Russia to be enemies anymore.
Why would we be allies with the Putin's Russian mob? The entire country is a criminal state. Patton was right after WW2 - we should have quickly re-armed the Germans and continued marching east and taken Russia - just as he said at the time. They're incapable of self rule.
US antagonizing Russia with pointless NATO expansion, interventionist wars and Maidan uprising forced Russia and China - the countries that should have been natural rivals, not partners - together.  That alone is far worse than US having nice relationship with Russia.
How is the weather in Stalingrad today, comrade?
China looking to upgrade from high-altitude balloons to transmedium drones. 😬  https://t.co/6lAb4921ol
It means its already done! 
...and these are supposedly the same objects that flew for hours on end and dropped from 50,000+ft to 50ft in 0.78 seconds?  Impressive!
They've been testing those for a while, could be in use within a few years.
I don't think anyone completely knows what will exactly happen but if I had to use my intuition I'd say it's going to be a 10 day blackout from a solar flare covered up or blamed on a China EMP balloon . WWIII scare event that will make Joe Biden the out to be the traitor he is.
MAIN EVENT COMING
What main event though? Scare event QFS Stock market Castle Rock Which one??
The markets will soon crash after the blackout and the government will default. Trump will be reinstalled due to the fraudulent 2020 election and will introduce the new financial system and the Golden Age will begin.
Do you know when this is going to happen like anytime soon? I heard that the scare event is pretty much here.
Pretty much 
Thank you so much. I totally appreciate your information. Your awesome
The people "cracking down" on Chinese shipments of goods to Russia, are the same people who allowed a BALLOON from China to tour our country for 7 days. Let that sink in.
Beijing has remained officially unaligned in the Ukraine war, yet China has sent Russia large volumes of goods that either civilians or the military could use.  U.S. officials vowed to crack down on such shipments, but that has proved hard to police.
2/19/2023 Miles Guo: The West will not fight a war in China because of two fatal issues; from the balloon incident, the West has truly realized that their threat comes from the CCP, rather than Chinese Laobaixing. That’s why pro-CCP figures such as Soros and Kissinger have to

slap their own faces now.
If it's a balloon, probably from China. If it's a grenade, probably from Russia. If it's a rainbow flag, a US citizen sent that.😂
Blinken: “China sent a surveillance balloon over our territory, violating our sovereignty, violating internatl law."  WaPo recently reported U.S. intel began tracking balloon’s trajectory imm. after it was launched from southern China &amp; unexpected weather blew it off course.
What is China profiting from the spy balloons? Thats what I would ask in return.   These balloons being sent from the South China Sea. Gathering worldwide Intel from low altitude. This is fanning a lot of issues.
China accuses US of 'fanning the flames' in Ukraine, claims US is 'profiting' from war
When do the people in Ohio get any airtime from Biden or his administration? All they get is a phone call. What did anyone think would happen, it took him 2 years to visit the American border, a week to shoot down a China balloon and now 2 weeks to call up Ohio and see what's up.
One year after Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free.  The United States will continue to work with our allies and partners to stand against Russia’s aggression and provide critical support to the people of Ukraine.
We are, its standard tactics, hit factories with any ties to DOD and disrupt railways, then destroy airtravel with a few EMP from balloons and the country will be crippled, especially since we have very little oil reserves to even fight a war past a week. China isnt dumb.
If you do anything like your past actions you would definitely be weak &amp; not respond- China balloon fiasco&amp; your withdrawal from Afghanistan are prime examples
Biden: "Would we respond? Or would we look the other way? Would we be strong? Or would we be weak? Would be, you, we would be, would we...the, all of our allies would be united, or divided?"
Trump let three spy balloons fly unmolested. He gets $20 million a year from the Bank of China in rent. Invanka Trump got numerous Chinese trademarks. The Trump family is beholden to China.
The US Embassy is back to normal business operations.  Local authorities investigated and cleared a suspicious package outside the Embassy.  Thanks to for your swift action, and thanks to all visitors for your cooperation and patience at this time.
It's prediction for what they will do in the future they don't care about you and people just like 9 II   these kinda things are inside job to spread agenda and fear for NWO 
Y’all hiring?
Was there a balloon?
Good to hear!
Wasn't Sam Smith was it? You can keep them
Probably they will blame Russia for it 
Zionists did it.
There won't be peace for the wicked
Aliens sure 
All clear it was just Prince Andrew walking around nude because he had a spontaneous sweating episode.
Another Chinese balloon 
It was another balloon wasn't it
Another script from the producers of the Nord Stream pipeline attackers.
I apologized profusely, because it was my lunch package that was delivered from Uber.

A big thank you to the British metropolice for your swift action

So who left their cheese petité breakfast croissânt bag outside?
Oh, is the package similar to the one you used to bl*w up the nord stream pipeline?

Political activists in Britain, when are you going to declare IRGC as a terrorist organization? When they kill hundreds of your citizens? Or when they eventually start World War III?  #IRGCterrorists  #MahsaAmini  #MEKterrorists

The purposely created chaos, from chemical spills, factories fires, to balloons, weather modifications, psychological warfare ,all in desperation to trigger WW3. We do not want war!
who owes nothing, fears nothing.That must be why u, from ur armed citizens to ur highest political, are paranoid who conspire against all the peoples of the world to maintain their hegemony, and brand Rusia as imperialist for defending itself.A thief believes everyone else steals
another hoax to continue diverting attention from your crimes
Imo, someone planted a 'false flag' device, to take attention of the news cycle away from the disastrous Ukraine situation and other events that the mainstream media is lying about.
Stop falling for propaganda
Failed FALSE FLAG FROM BRITISH /AMERICAN WARMMONGERS WANTING WW3 YESTERDAY   I BET
Yes we need money to build our military equipment back up for when China strikes. And they plan on it sooner than you think because they just sent balloon to get location to where they need to strike wisely and Biden administration let them . We need to build a secret one again
BREAKING REPORT: Rumors emerge House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be STRIPPING UKRAINE AID from multiple spending bills including the OMNIBUS SPENDING PACKAGE and stop-gap funding bill...  Do you SUPPORT this decision?
Well Joe Biden Putin listen to you about just a little incursion and thought that was the green light from you to roll tanks into Ukraine. Words matter. Like this five balloon from China was nothing to be afraid of
BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS RUINING OUR COUNTRY. I am sick and giving money to the Ukraine letting China float a balloon over our defenses. The Biden family all took money from China, Ukraine and Russia. How can we let this happen? illegals streaming across our border IM SICK
Colourful 🇯🇵  Some people enjoying the Japanese Northern Alps by hot air Balloon. I bet the view is amazing.   - Lucky bastards.  Don't worry it's not from China. 😆 https://t.co/xu24BrqDrT
The spy balloon or ‘China balloon’ (as referred to by fat, orange cretins), was clearly an attack on the US. Newly released CIA analysis shows the device sucked the last remaining intelligence from people who looked at it. https://t.co/TTmuSSQU2G
Still can't believe we never referred to the spy balloon shootdown as the inflation reduction act
Might’ve been a spy balloon pilot but from Ethiopia instead of China.
#Aliens #UFO
 This is fantastic!
Oh snap! That is hilarious... truly.
Holy shit!  Do you remember 2 weeks ago when China flew a spy balloon across our entire country?  Do you remember the weak ass exit from Afghanistan?  He is the opposite of a leader.
U.S. completes recovery of debris from downed Chinese spy balloon, heading to FBI lab.   #ChinaSpyBalloon #China
and FUCK all the news and political discourse has been so depressing lately too. One year anniversary of war in Ukraine, massive environmental disaster from a negligent corporation, growing tensions with China over a fucking balloon, even car-dependency is depressing.
U.S. completes recovery of debris from downed Chinese spy balloon, heading to FBI  https://t.co/HNxOvNHuZz
all them damn balloon’s coming from china or ?
There has been a lot of attention on the Chinese balloon that was shot down, with China claiming that the US has also flown balloons over China. From a policy perspective, this incident reveals how few voices there in Washington for a more moderate approach to China.
Owning some clothing stores is selling out the country to China? Good Grief your priorities are skewed. "10%for the big guy" , Burisma, a spy balloon sailing from one end of the country to the other?
Time and time again, Adam Schiff has gotten the facts wrong. But the facts are not complicated, and were confirmed by both witnesses tonight: No bribery, no extortion, no withholding of aid, no quid pro quo.  WATCH part 1 
You’re wrong on this. This wasn’t appropriate for a president to do. Regardless of party. If you want to defend the president, then ok, but don’t prentend the actions were acceptable.
There is a HUGE difference between inappropriate and Illegal and impeachable offence. How many democrat members kids sit on boards in the Ukraine exactly?
Are you kidding?  Ivanka is selling our country out to China . We're not supposed to be dealing with them with no trade deal.
🤣🤣While the 30 million in anonymous donations from China to the Penn Biden Center allowed the Chinese to fly a spy balloon across America for a week.
😂😂 was this a joke? Alienate from the west who arms Taiwan, allege china sent Chinese virus, shoots kids balloons!!
Zelensky of Ukraine has said: If China allies itself with Russia, there will be World War III.
China wouldn’t alienate themselves from the world for Russia. IMHO
War would be a concrete reason to stop trade.  Balloons and viruses are kids play in comparison. Trade is money, money is life. Sadly.
YOU literally wrote this yesterday.   That’s when I figure out my time has been wasted
So they don't sell to us and inflation skyrockets for us. They will lose some but can still sell to India and Russia. Can't wait to pay 50% more for everything.
They would look pretty stupid holding their guns over train cars that are derailed and burned out. It's not like guarding Ohioans from an errant giant balloon from China floating above the flight paths. Now that was a photo op for the MAGATs.
Ohio train derailment.......JD Vance and Jim Jordan, NOWHERE in sight.
It's all Dok's fault I reckons. He sent them balloons from China.
Is it me, or have we seen so many more “incidents” recently? Ever since the spy balloon from China? What if the balloon was carrying some type of zero-day Bug!
So many balloons from Happy birthday to me 🎈  Please follow me on for some amateur info on Communist China, Hong Kong and politics in general! https://t.co/T6mlPGBnRX
But beyond that, it flew over mainland US without so much as an "oops" from China until after we saw it and complained. If it was REALLY an accident and a harmless "weather balloon", don't you think they would notify us ahead of time? Would have made things SO much better!  2/2
Sec. Blinken: 'No apology' from China for spy balloon scandal   https://t.co/RhDfWb0Nj1
Washington D.C. logic is US must defend itself from harmless balloons by arming Taiwan in violation of One China Policy, building military bases in Philippines, and giving nuclear subs to Australia.  It's defense I tell ya, balloons are very dangerous! https://t.co/AZxnHhLRUF
There is growing concern for WWIII.  And if people knew how Europe sleepwalked into WWI, it is a real possibility. God forbid. A WW3 would probably mean we will all be dead.  Hard to believe that many leaders are pushing for escalation to make a wider war more likely.  Criminal.
Trump jaunts down from AF1 &lt;&gt; Biden falls up. 3 times.  Trump says China Virus &lt;&gt; Biden says Chinese spy Balloon and shoots down a 20 dollar balloon with a $400,000 missile  Trump says "make America great again" &lt;&gt; Biden says "Trunalimunumaprzure"  There is no "what about Trump?"
It’s a metal balloon from Xi Jinping.  China is figuring out if Biden will shoot it up
Feb 15 - The balloon may have been  accidentally drifted and the resulting tensions with China might have been a mistake - The balloon was probably on course toward the US territory of Guam when it took an unexpected turn north due to strong winds https://t.co/a2JmBnpCiq
Spy Balloons and UFOs: The entire world is now speaking about the Spy Balloon that made its way from China to the continental United...   The post Spy Balloons and UFOs appeared first on Curiosmos. https://t.co/4L7YyF4Oqg #history #weird #science https://t.co/FypK1E7Rac
It’s a gift from Xi or Putin. Xi thanks us for shot down balloon and Putin for Nordstrom 2. Add to that the new addition to Fentanyl that destroys your skin and makes you look like a leper an additional gift from China. Biden really is f.. us up
It's an underwater spi balloon🎈from China
I don't think the objects we shot down (other than giant Spy Balloon) were from China.  I am still waiting for pictures of the cigar shaped objects.  "Most likely" isn't a definite.  I want to know WTF these things were, and I don't trust you or anybody.  U politicize this.
No, treason is defined as "giving aid and comfort to the enemy", like letting a spy balloon you've known about since it took off from China complete its mission flying over of a large part of the country and sending data back to China before shooting it down.
China already had that information from the spy balloon Biden let fly across the entire country.
I followed this supposed balloon from China for three hours today to intercept it, only to realize it was bird poop on my windshield. https://t.co/9D6ArsXftU
Ever since those China balloons, Americans are erroneously believing what they see in the sky is from China. That's not reality or fact. Joe Biden knows the truth #yahjal12 https://t.co/Ms0ankJT0N
The chief representative for the Biden administration claimed last weekend that China made no apologies for the surveillance balloon that had flown across a significant portion of the United States.  https://t.co/RhDfWb0Nj1
The fact that people think China would need bloody balloons to spy is laughable. All they'd need is point cloud mapping from infiltrated smartphones that don't just spy on you, but anyone and anything, around you. :) https://t.co/fTRlptKRd7
X Just went to a birthday party and saw these. The bloody Chinese are everywhere. Has anyone got a spare $400,000 missile? Might need 8 if you have them :)
Maybe it was just an accident.
That would be like inviting China’s spy balloons to hover over every American missile base…remember, your big bogus issue from last really, really swivels like a weathervane.
It’s 2023 and we watched the “strongest” nation on earth get bed terrors from a solar powered helium filled balloon.
nah Bro they already visit us...but they got confused by the EEUU after the Balloon issues from China.
This can’t be real 
Again… another reason aliens will never visit earth. 
Are you a queer with a small amount of autism?
The Chinese spy balloon's eight-day flight path suggests China is gathering intelligence for a strike on America's nukes. I would guess both China and Russia are preparing for the next world war. I would suggest both Europe and USA immediately stop all imports from China.
Now a Uranium compound of is on fire at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee  I think I speak on behalf of millions of Americans when I ask - what the actual hell is going on?!  Are we under attack?!  The American people deserve the truth  PC: https://t.co/bi3ChqS8u9
Thankfully the fire has been contained but my questions above still stand
You’re in the government. WE deserve the truth FROM YOU.
This is the natural conclusion demanded by capitalism
Grow up.  You have no problem taking capitalistic money...
From your own government?
I think they're all republican states, would be my guess.
Congress needs to start providing answers to the American people.
The kakistocracy isn't going to tell us anything. Never have we had more worthless government. Both parties are rotten to the core.
I think this was handled quickly and was not a huge deal like it sounds
Uranium in any amount is dangerous and a huge deal. Honey, they make nuclear bombs with it. It’s dangerous..
I know honey, it’s a short drive from where I live.  Oak Ridge is a pretty serious place and I’m just saying I think they had the resources to handle it pretty quickly
Exactly, Raw Alerts posted the update 4 minutes after the initial advisement. Could have been anything with that quick of turnaround. But of course panic helps certain causes so here we are.
Of course we are.  They just won't acknowledge it because then people will demand they do something about it and our open border.  They want issues and an open border so people will demand more govt to "fix" the problems.
That's 45 minutes from here.  Omgahhh!!
About that far from me too.
I think it’s a bad look if we are being attacked by a foreign nation and our federal govt isn’t identifying or addressing it. Maybe our federal govt is complicit in these “accidents”.
Ya think?
People who work there are on lockdown. I asudsme that is standard procedure in case there was a radioactive leak. But that also means there is a chance that could have happened. So no, not everything is fine.
This doesn't seem like that big of a deal right ?
This has been obvious for some time. The significance of targets will continue to increase.
They have given me no reason to believe the official narrative  The official narrative might be true, but they’re going to have to provide a lot more facts
THE Oak Ridge? Yes, we better find out quick WTF!?
The short answer is yes… protection of critical infrastructure needs to be put in place throughout the country by mobilizing appropriate state or local agencies.
The most transparent administration ever.
I believe  we are under attack....
There’s a book that describes these events happening. According to it, the power grid is next( you’ve noticed the attacks?) And communication centers down after that Then comes chaos and starvation It’s been thought out about 8 years ago And Finally, we are under attack. clearly
A friend here locally has a son working  in Y12, and they haven’t been able to get a hold of him all day. Prayers
Total land grab 
almost 2 years ago, scientist blew the whistle on CRT policies being implemented at the agency in charge. Me thinks these policies and hiring that followed may be leading to all these disasters. Maybe, hiring on attributes and not ability...
I think I might need to load another 1000 rds or so.
Didn’t Russians get caught a few times back  last year around our uranium facilities
From Within Yes!
An explosion or a Uranium fire could release gaseous uranium near the facility, which would cause kidney problems and possible cancer if inhaled or ingested. 
These sorts of accidents - not necessarily involving uranium, mind you, but ordinary chemical or industrial accidents - happen quite frequently. People are just very sensitive to the topic because of the Ohio train derailment.
These things have been going on a lot longer than the derailment in Ohio.
That's the point.
Rolling back Regulations Republican style!
I know right! Regulating pipelines for us and blowing up others and then we can our biolabs on the edge of say Canada and maybe Mexico so we can regulate work, school, travel, recreation and this time we should be able to regulate eating since destroying 70% processing food.
Bot say Gibberish?
You’re posting a question to Twitter instead of reporting the answer from you asking this to the FBI.
Yes we are under attack and have been for quite some time.
Indeed.
Considering millions of illegals have been allowed to cross the border, including some instances of Chinese nationals, it could be covert sabotage and we wouldn’t know.
But we do.
YES. #CCP
I learn something new everyday and that book looks is friggin scary . The Chinese are now running the Canadian govt . Trudeau sold us down the river .
All that black smoke is heading to Canada but it will not matter because Trudeau is going to starve and freeze us to death
 Praying that doesn't happen. We are all in dire straits the world over. Just stay alert &amp; be aware of situations happening around you &amp; everywhere else. Try to prepare in case such a tragedy should happen.
Just another coincidence.
I find it very interesting that they are all happening in republican run states.  Just like crime is highest in republican run states.
Said nobody ever
The enemy within.
WTF????
Under attack by Antifa
Why all the chemical “accidents”? twitter.com/CarlDevitt/sta…
Don't worry I heard it is safe and effective.
Nuclear ignition lol, some electrical panel probably smoked up it wasn't litterally uranium on fire.
So da news made it sound worse than it is ? Do dey do that alot ?
Litterally any time anything even tangentially related to nuclear is involved.
That's why it's a "major response!"... always is, because it's taken super-seriously even when it's a wet fart in a containment room.
I know I speak for #WeTheMajority of rational Americans who don't become triggered by an event and fire off an aggressive comment with demands to get  response clicks.   We pause and wait for further reports to come in as they did and we verify everything. #PauseVerifyShare
Did they or Ohio see balloons
1 st the motorhome .. now this …America is under attack
A better question is WHO IS ATTACKING US?? It’s coming from within!!
You know how to tell?  You don't see any investigations going from the DOJ or FBI.
Why would they investigate themselves
Yes it is chaos so we break and submit to tyranny
I will never get a fucking break! 
yes you would be correct Draino..  The has done it's job.. how many chemical explosions &amp; train derailments since it passed??  How many coincidences until it is mathmatically impossible..
This is a great point but some of the places the balloon never went over.
yep, &amp; their still not saying what was found on the payload, so it's pretty safe to say until proven otherwise the chemical explosions &amp; destruction that have happened nearly daily since the traversed our Country has too many coincidences!
Yep. I'm thinking just an idea is that they have been running hacks on a lot of systems. Because in Ohio the train went 20 miles and only had one tripped sensor.
well define what a common denominator is .. that should answer ur question to 99.99% of your tweets
Publish accident stat lists for previous 10 years to see it is always bad.
Yes, by diversity hires. Every company/plane/train is a ticking time bomb.
Biden removed every barrier he could for criminals and terrorists….this is his legacy
Lord knows there have been enough people come in the southern border undetected that could cause a tremendous amount of damage.
We are 100% under attack, have been for atleast a year now.
And where is Gretta again?
These are NOT all coincidences
I no longer think that we have to ask that question.
We all know who’s leadership brought us to this point in time, it is the corrupt branch of the neo-liberal democrats who, through a self-righteous brainwashing campaign forced candidates and rules no one wanted through fear mongering and fascism in self righteous disguise
There are numerous things happening every day.  We are definitely not safe under this Administration.
Hi, I live here. It was contained quickly and everything is actually fine. Please don’t psyop my county Y12 isn’t a joke.
Well, we ARE under attack (but I think you probably know that). But the MSM is actually reporting on this, and we are to believe that everything is contained and that there were no leaks, no radiation escaped, and everything is perfectly fine. 
It looks like the Chinese CCP got the images they needed
Been saying this for two weeks.
Wow…for real though
Are we at war?
Payback is a Bitch #Nordstream2
Dude, do the math.  An average of 37,000 fires occur at industrial and manufacturing properties every year.
The word terror is being kept out of all dialogue
what is going on is WAR
I have to agree. It started before the 2020 election with plans to steal it.
I think that the same elite that is suffering the Europeans, now it’s the turn of US
I live very close to Oak Ridge. A fire there is terrifying and should never happen. I don't know if we are under attack or if we are seeing the effects of DEI hires.Everything you go to do, you deal with people that can't do their jobs.
From our own country.
I'm afraid you have to look for the perpetrators in your very own ranks
Many of these are being done in predominantly Republican stated.
Walks like a duck, looks like a duck, sqwaucks like a duck, I haven't counted across USA but there are too many to be accidental.
This is war 
They need a distraction from Ohio
The balloon flew over the facility when it crossed America…
“Are we under attack?!” Yes.
You can't blow up the Nordstream pipeline and not expect a little payback....
With terrorists and Taliban walking across our southern border who knows?
Looks like the spy balloon has marked all these target's and is now setting it's findings in action.
Literally every single day it’s something new. Weird.
A lot of us from TN noticed that the spy balloon managed to veer south and go pretty much right over Oak Ridge. Not saying these incidents are related, but good grief.
Every day there is something new just like clockwork.   It's almost like we should start betting on what state will have the next fire or derailment?
YES!!! We are. Has anyone heard reports that the ef be eye is working on this and going to catch whoever is behind these attacks? Nope, that’s because they’re in on it IMO.
"I have several rules I live by.  The first: I don't believe anything the government tells me.  Nothing.  Zero!"  -- George Carlin
Why, it's almost like decades of deregulation and disinvestment in infrastructure has consequences!?
We are at war, the Federal government better start acting like it
I am within minutes of this place nothing I can do except pray and enjoy life
I’m sure our government is going to tell us that Russia or China is responsible for this but I’m gonna tell you I think the United States and the FBI is responsible for all of this.if it is China &amp;Russia well then the United States helped them. Just like Covid
How can you attack a national security facility?  I’m not understanding all this middle America disasters, far from natural disasters
We have been under attack for a long time. What do you think 2020 was?
I only live a few miles away, brother-in-law works at Y-12 he said the public will only know what their news dept puts out/as of now no injuries/no contamination/everything is contained/no safety issues. No cause reported why/how the fire started.
DO we have saboteurs crossing our WIDE OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER???
I've said it since the east Palestine incident, and when they arrested that journalist live streaming from the location I knew something was off. America is under attack and they're keeping it from the American people.
Oh yes, we have been under attack for a long time now my friend, its just becoming a lot more obvious and deadly.  And for all the people who doubt whats happening, do you get it... yet?
And why isn't something done about it to secure the Homeland? (ON PURPOSE?) I guess the ones awake need to completely realize we are on our own!
I live fairly close to Oak Ridge. Everyone here takes ORNL very seriously. They seemed to have had the situation under control quickly.
Looks like there's yet another major accident. Again. 
Sabotage all around the USA?
1000s of these catch fire every year?
It seems like that movie where North Korea invades the United States, the second movie was going to come out, but apparently it's not a movie, it's reality.
 WTF????
It's part of the plan. Crisis .
The "truth" is that the fires's been contained, no injuries or contaminations have been reported, and the parts of the facility are back to normal operations.
We have been under constant attack since January 20, 2021.
Too many “coincidences” add up to the fact of the matter. And I don’t think it’s from an outside entity……
Stop hiring people that do it for the money. Bring back true apprenticeships train the best and brightest...accidents happen, these gloveboxes are pretty much bomb proof, have filtration systems and fire suppression systems that are pretty damn good. 10 years ago a nun broke in.
The current administration has let millions of people just walk across our border and disappear into the country.  Is anyone really surprised that this is happening?
Certainly seems we are under attack.  It seems many people are wondering what's going to happen next. I've been selling freeze dried food on the internet and there is a sudden pickup in sales, really sudden. It isn't cheap but people want it. I don't ask why.
We are
I do believe we are under attack.  I hope the NG &amp; sheriffs depts are gearing up for security.  I think all factories &amp; grain mills etc need to have a plan to have people do daily inspections of their facilities. We need surveillance by air (choppers) over all our train tracks.
I'm remembering when right wing extremists recently attacked power grids. But I'm sure they wouldn't do anything devious to distract from Trump's impending indictments.
Yes. Enough
WOULDNT BE A TEENSY BIT SURPRISED. Many of these plants use internet to monitor and control ,production, storage, transportation of the toxins highly flammable compounds and mixtures.wouldnt be the least bit surprised if those internet controls have been hacked.
Have we ever gotten a single plausible explanation from investigators for how all these fires have been starting over the past couple of years?
Uranium can catch fire; article about a 1957 incident.
The question isn't "are we under attack", it's "who is attacking us?" I think the answer is pretty obvious.
Yes. As a nation we are under attack from white christian-nationalists. But, I don't think it's related to this uranium fire.
The day after Putin announced that 90% of America's nuclear deterrent has expired, but Russia's has not. The devastating consequences of the 2020 coup by Democrats and RINOs cannot be over-stated.
Hmmm... I remember a certain Russian arms dealer being let free and an open order in the south...
Perhaps you should listen to Tore Says Show (Rumble) she has been talking about this and also Scott McKay Patriot Street fighter had a guest overwatch that completed the pieces.
Jesus
Inside job, all of them.
never ending winter
Before it was food production plants, now the latest trend seems to be chemicals...But of course they'll just say we're imagining it, this is totally normal, we just didn't notice it before. Yeah.
We are being attacked from within
At this point this all must be planned. Time to stock up on goods and all.
Yes, and yes !
Congresswoman's Marsha Blackburn has been updating the situation
Didn't you realize that there are consecutive terrorist attacks on course?
Uh, ya!
Is biden in charge of it? this is scary
No, we’ve just been massively underinvesting in infrastructure for several decades and the bill is coming due
Are the Oak Ridge Boys safe?
YES we’re under attack. From within and likely by our own people.
They seem like attacks to me
This is what happens after years of anti-government/anti-regulation sentiment. Deregulation to the point of lack of safety
No, it's just that Trump and the GOP rolled back all the safety regs and now we are feeling it.
Where are the facility VIDEOS of how these explosions/fires started?  All we get is videos of something already on fire. We should be trying CATCH them!
There must be saboteurs active within our borders... what else can explain what is happening? Are the new Representatives in Congress seeing this???
Time to do a nuclear audit.  Let's make sure all of ours are verified and secured.   Let's not have any more "environmental accidents" from suspicious neglect.
I know bad stuff happens but now when anything happens I assume it's part of a vast conspiracy!
OMG again !
We are under attack. Biden has left the building.  This podcast sums up greatly. Time to wake up patriots and normies.
Bidens Chinese buddies!
Hypothetically speaking, there might be a power struggle going on somewhere in the world.  There could also be a huge border that leaks like a sieve.  It could be a coincidence.
The American people need to get MORE guns because the government tyranny is just getting started. Never let them take our guns, and never let them take our freedom.
Most likely yes, we are. Particularly when our “leadership” clearly hates America and it’s People. #FJB #Traitor #Tyrant
Elect clowns and the whole country turns into a circus.
Well, Brandon did blow up Russia's gas pipeline, an act of sabotage and economic warfare. And now that China has bought the gas and Russia is getting cozy with XiPing, we are pretty much screwed. What did he expect? No response? Brandon has endangered the USA.
We have a domestic enemy - $GOOGL - which aides other enemies, foreign &amp; domestic. This is a screenshot from #GoogleMaps for that facility.
#GoogleMaps also shows enhanced photos of the US Air Force bases with resolutions down to 1-2 inches.
People need to wake up to this! - These events are too similar and frequent (closely timed) to be anything other than gorilla warfare by some organization. Its time America identify them and take the battle *to
Chinese Democrat Biden?
Do you honestly believe the Biden administration, which in my eyes is actively working to destroy the US, would give us a factual statement about what’s going on? I don’t.
I would not doubt Russia taking them out. America has set itself up to be a threat to the world.
Nobody would dare to attack ; except .
You don't have to ask on my behalf because I already know that the United States of America is currently enduring a cold war.
The democrats complete loss of control of the U S Is what’s happening.    It’s not gonna get better.  This is the work of terrorist organizations.   This is all the warning we will see.   Don’t expect  the FAKE president to come on tv n tell you HE SUCKS.
The balloons didn't work, so they are scaling up the distractions.  It all boils down to the depth of corruption in the government.  It will be uncovered, watch.  This is the Clinton clan creating fodder to distract everyone.
Not enough folks took the depopulation clot shots , now they want to depopulate by getting folks to breathe in dangerous and hazardous chemicals !   In my opinion of course
I don,t like their plans and what to stop them . Kill the soil kill the people
Republican states are under attack in USA
Do you really believe Biden is capable of telling the truth.
Yes, we have entered WW3. Some people will notice sooner than others. And some will have to have a bomb dropped on their house before they will believe.
Putin &amp; Xi play the game to win, to not think they have placed sleeper agents within the US to effect response against things like the Nord stream pipe line, is a mistake. The bigger mistake is to fail to see Putin &amp; how his mind works. Biden &amp; Co have already lost 
Biden has let millions of military aged single men into this country. It could be any one of them...or our own citizens!! But yes, we are under attack and too blind to see it!
I work in Oak Ridge They take things extremely seriously at the Lab.  This was a non event.
Of course we are under attack by our own Government. They have let in all their army across our boarders. We have illegals from every ememy country in the world. They don't come to work and build this country but to tear it down. They used to come to work, not any longer.  .
Exactly what I have been saying. Notice Biden has fled the country.
The home base of the Manhattan project? 
I'm sure what they found on #balloongate can answer all your questions.  Oh wait...it's classified. 
We were under attack the day Hussien got installed in the White House. It's just gotten more aggressive with an empty meat suit at the helm.
Its the deep state.They want war .So attack our defenses Plain and simple.16 year plan in overdrive to get  the US into a war so the US looses. Then the criminal syndicate in the deep state  can tear up the constitution . Orders from the world economic forum elites.
Gotta ask yourself did we have these problems under Trump then you'll realize it's the Deep State
So you’re ok with a country using nuclear weapons? Because why wouldn’t Putin if China has their back.  Nobody wins with nuclear war. We could even stop a balloon from entering our country.
When a megalomaniac dictator like Putin uses the threat of World War III to convince the world to roll over for him, you don’t roll over.  To the GOP spreading fear of World War III, you are acting like Putin’s pawns.   Standing for America = Standing against Putin’s threats
Launch from western China and you can recreate the original spy balloon!  Check out this spy balloon simulator using real atmospheric data! https://t.co/3XuUy3Xzx5
Financial Times- “Western officials now believe the balloon may have drifted off its intended course.”  Not a spy balloon. Stop falling for hysterics from warmongers in the government. You are being played. https://t.co/i7QWGKDNRv
Conservatives know the government lied to them about Covid.  They know the government is lying about Ukraine.  But surely the government must be telling the truth about the balloon… because China!  Be aware of your biases. They are easily exploited.
U.S. tracked China spy balloon from launch on Hainan island along unusual path - The Washington Post https://t.co/K7dVOUODZi
I live about 35 miles away from OAK Ridge and I hope it doesn't have anything to with the China Spy Balloon going over it a couple of weeks ago!!!
Just checking wind patterns from there. All going north, north east until it hits some little town called East Palestine. Then just swirls in a circle.
The Chinese Spy Balloon Saga, Part 2  Heather Zeiger: China continues to deny using the balloon to spy on military bases  https://t.co/NMHnEC7Iqu  The U.S. has shot down 4 aerial objects this month. One was a Chinese surveillance balloon that went from Idaho to the Atlantic.
U.S. military recovers electronic sensors from downed Chinese balloon https://t.co/iz5foKMivH
1: He sounds and speaks exactly like Saagar Enjeti, so 🚩. 2: It was not a spy balloon, it was a weather balloon that was blown off course, so he’s already lying to push war talk. 3: He’s pushing war with China over economics…how is that different from the same old establishment
This photo of China's spy balloon taken from a U-2 reconnaissance plane is absolutely bonkers (video) https://t.co/pfRiD7DWh0 https://t.co/zH6XiuXGZH
what’s more bonkers is the chemical spills &amp; train derailments, especially in #OhioChemicalDisaster #Ohio #OhioTrainDisaster #ohiotrainderailment
What is really bonkers are people who hijack posts to talk about things totally not related to the topic.
I thought it was a free country.
Now we just need a selfie of said “ufo”
#sataloon
What about when everyone was mostly inside during COVID.  I think more was happening then
Hahaha como vcs sao burro carai
Quite a photo released by Pentagon, showing snapshot of Chinese spy balloon taken by pilot on U-2. https://t.co/ItjbfD0tpH  Now we just need China to release a picture of the U-2 taken from the balloon.  #ChinaSpyBalloon https://t.co/wWgDJXJoNM
This photo will be on the cover of every aviation and science magazine
Shame the U2 doesn’t have a gun.  Some holes in the bag would have probably made a slower descent and much better intelligence gathering from the wreckage.
Very close flyby
That's not possible. U2 totally jam the balloon electronic signals .
I'm sure some boffin will be able to geolocate the picture
We're still waiting for the confirmation on the "spying" part, Hans. Any news on that?
it's a weather balloon, jackass
It's a weather balloon. It doesn't generate propaganda photos.  Unlike the Chinese, we have a history of taking out civilian targets.  Not something to be proud of.
 you are a scientist?
My question is which MPs got fund for their campaign from #China  You? ? Who? Was the fund transferred by balloons? You can seizes bank accounts, so we must in measure to see who got ? Can u ask the PM please?
Inbox from DOD: "A U.S. Air Force pilot looked down at the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon as it hovered over the Central Continental United States February 3, 2023." https://t.co/9kGgqAz6Vm
Was just thinking it had been a few blissfully balloon-free days in my inbox
That is one hell of a selfie
Isn't that a U2 he's flying?
Nice U2.
Oddly clear pictures - +60k feet higher rate of speed vs balloon traveling with the wind. Hi res - can zoom in pretty well. Wonder how pictures turned out of the other objects?
Is the US planning on taking way our #freedom? If a #CBDC is rolled out, you can bet it does!  What's your opinion on this? Are we moving dangerously close to Chinese policies?  Join the debate this Sunday in our #TwitterSpace !
The reason it's bad Fox can report on the 1/6 surveillance footage is Tucker is going to show the Kremlin where the Capitol safe rooms are and how to find them.   This insanity is shared by an MSNBC host and a Dem member of Congress and seems normal to standard liberal voters:
He's undergoing cancer treatment and radiation. I wonder why the right side of Joy Reid's body seems to be in the process of being consumed by some form of marine life, but nothing but best wishes to Rep. Raskin in his cancer treatment (I presume you didn't know: no problem).
Wow, I had no idea. Thanks for explaining. I first saw him wearing one during the hearings with former Twitter folks, but I was out of the country and out of the loop really. Seeing a different one on him again today, weeks later, was pretty confusing.
This is psychology 101: confirmation bias fueling cognitive dissonance.
why does he wear the head wrap
Oh, I had no idea he was trans
This from a guy who wears a suit and a do- rag.
Not defending Raskin, but he is going through cancer treatments. He is still a piece of crap though.
I'm down with whatever they find, good bad or ugly.   I just want the full story, not a cherry picked narrative.
I'm willing to bet $100 Putin knows where that sh1t is!
Now the Russian paratroopers will know exactly where to land. How can they keep getting away with this?
Or the *domestic terrorist that engaged in overt coup-plotting fascist treason like 5 minutes ago....
Do you regard what happened on January 6th as a coup?
It was a blatant coup *attempt. The only people who don't see it are the sad propaganda dupes who fell for the whole "stolen election" bit.
That one guy did have the speaker podium.  He could have used some very harsh language. Thank heavens he showed restraint. Otherwise, we would all be speaking viking now.
Out of interest, given that Hannity, Carlson, and Ingraham didn't believe the election was stolen "for one minute," does that make them Rinos?
If you say so? Who cares?  Stay on topic.
Why is he giving interview while wearing underwear pulled over his head?
What moor do you need to know?
Two free democratic elections since then-Yanukovitch nowhere to be seen
Yanukovitch had to run for his life after the Nazis tried to Assassinate him. He was overthrown illegally. They where 10 Votes short to oust him. They then tried to Assassinate him why would he come back.
It is the ultimate scarcity mentality to reduce all the way down to a space for bare survival of an individual. There is just not enough safe space in the world for this kind of absurdity.
So sweet of you to carry Fox's water
'Journalist'
She carries so much water she might as well be a water Buffalo.
They could have released sanitized footage two years ago. Too late now.
Too busy sanitizing the capitol walls from the MAGA feces  left 1/6/21
Seems strange that if an "insurrection" revealed security features at the capitol, that those features wouldn't have been changed.
Good optics.
Man, everybody quoting "Putin's Playbook" ... is this sold on Amazon?
Oh shit!!...it's Putins playbook again!!.
AKA...Russia, Russia, Russia..............RUSSIA!
The say ridiculous things repeatedly and just expect people to take it as gospel… and it works. Utterly absurd
No doubt Swalwell gave  Fang Fang a complete tour of the Capital.
I'd given up on theories about some nefarious actors behind the Jan 6 riot, but just from seeing the reaction of Raskin and MSNBC, I'm now pretty convinced there's something there.
Kevin McCarthy should simply release the footage to everyone, not just Fox.
Dems love dehumanizing people with ad hominen attacks 
If the reason for this was transparency and getting this out to everyone to try to depolarize things then why would you give exclusive footage to tucker carlson, who about everyone outside of the fox news bubble is going to ignore, and can be easily delegitimized
Release the footage. The public deserves to see it. Not just corporate news networks.
Yep there is moor.
I thought January 6 was worse than 9/11 and Pearl Harbor combined. Just move the damn security cameras after the footage is released. Not hard.
Tucker is a proven liar Glenn, hardly a reliable source for impartiality.
I'm more concerned about the fact that Tucker is a language abusing radicalizing fascist propagandist. Why you excuse such is a bit of a mystery.
Tucker Carlson tried to get a Fox reporter fired because she reported the truth about the election, which he thought was threatening to Trump and to Fox' stock price. Not exactly a straight shooter, Glenn, who can be reasonably trusted to present a fair picture
Methinks the anchor protest too much.
I don’t understand why only Tucker has access to the footage. Just release it to everyone, lol.
That’s comical….a minimum of 90% should standing outside with everyone else
Lol, in an invasion where we lost air superiority those safe rooms and the capitol would be long gone.
People still watch Joy?
Honestly I don’t know what’s worse.  Raskin’s natty bandana or that pangolin neck brace. This footage won’t go away.
Toojewpak is pro-Ukraine Moneylaundering for him and his homies.
As if they don’t already know, with all the traitors we have collecting government checks.
Theres MOOR?
see this footage is dangerous and can't be debated at mania.
Why is he wearing a durag? 
If only the KGB had Tucker Carlson in the 1960s. Then they would really have been formidable.
Glenn: what are they so scared of?  That they can no longer control the selective drip of info to pretend it was a coup attempt?
Lol. So if the Russians are in the Capitol moving from safe room to safe room I think the game is over and we are all screwed.  These progressives will say anything to cover their January 6th one-sided narrative.
This looks like a Saturday Night Live stunt!  What will be next?   Weather balloons to spy on the US spots that can looked through satellites?
What's up with the dress up party?  Based on what they're wearing and not reading the context I would assume they were reading lines for a kids fantasy show...
They had two years to do something with the videos. They chose wrongly.
Problem is, Nancy did such a crappy job with security, any spies could easily have accessed that info in person.
Release the tapes to the public. I don’t want bowtie’s weird authoritarian spin on what’s in them.
The only interesting thing yet to be shown is pence in the underground carpark.
Good for laughs, but clips like this are why avoid all cable news, Fox and MSNBC and CNN all together
Has he showed these safe rooms?
I have been waiting all week for Tucker to drop some video footage and it has never come. Anyone know when he is going to drop it all?
It's as normal and natural standard as the member of Congress hairdo.
Does that mean they aren't in the Capitol ? Asking for a friend
If they're safe rooms it doesn't matter where they are.
its amazing youre carrying water for fox and tucker like literally a week after it comes out that they were objectively lying about the election and knew they were lying
Why just fox? The goal is obvious. Make it all public.
MSNBC is full on neocon now.  They might as well give Bill Kristol his own show... except no one would actually want to watch that... lol
Does he wear a tinfoil hat?
Russia isn't our enemy. The enemy is within + the Zionist cabal which Russia intends to keep from crossing over into Russia.
Well, Tuck is a proven liar so...
Aha - thought that was you on the right there Glenn.  Brother from anothermother?
What makes these clowns think the Kremlin doesn't know where the Capitol safe rooms are and how to find them? If Ilhan Omar knows, they do as well.
They act like Putin is why kids are poor in America or something
If the J6 footage is a threat to security, then the security was already insufficient.
All the libs on tv seem to be hyperventilating over the J6 tapes. You’d think they would be applauding the release, you know, to prove all their stories. 
Jamie has something to hide 
Well, Putin will know where the bathrooms are if he ever visits again!    He won't have to ask.
will the russiagating never end?  come back to reality.  it's not happening for you.
2 of the lying con artist that will be exposed for being part of the misinformation spread of the J6 con, discuss how TC is the wrong person to tell America the truth.
Should have released the tapes to you or Matt. Not Tucker. Let independent journalists do what needs to be done. Tucker will cherry pick.
They know how damaging the footage is to their narrative and want to get ahead of the story to prime as many people as possible to ignore it. No matter what will be revealed, for NPCs it will be another nothingburger.
They believe it, bless their hearts.
Pretty sure the members of Congress who are compromised by the CCP and/or other entities, have already shared this information.
What's the point in engaging with this idol chatter? I can't even consider Jan 6 to be an insurrection. Why should I waste a breath on such mind numbing topics?
Paranoid delusion
Don’t they already know all that from Biden’s classified docs that have been spread willy nilly?
could be the chemo… but knowing Ruskin, he's just being himself.
Speaker McCarthy was forced to balance the security interests of the Capitol and Tucker Carlson's desire to try to rehabilitate the legacy of Donald Trump.    The Speaker opted for a totally hopeless effort to help Trump try to alter/distort reality.    Poor judgement.
The fear among Democrats and members of the J6 committee must be palpable. So much they do not want you to see because it does not fit their narrative and never did. Remember it started with Rep Adam Schiff secret hearings, Maybe we'll finally see truth.
Dude is Raskin wearing a bandana?
And what if the imaginary “the Jews” find out too? The imaginary “the Russians” scare me now more than my own shadow does. -run of the mill Democrat
DO THE DOMINION LAWSUIT MATERIALS AND MISUSE OF A JOURNALISTIC PLATFORM BY FOX PERSONALITIES!!!
Silly, the Russians just have to ask China for detailed layout of the Capitol and the safe rooms
To be honest it's very difficult to take a grown man calling himself 'Jamie' seriously.   not to mention he's a Communist like his father before him.  also a shameless race hustler
Fox News had 89 of the 100 highest-rated telecasts for the week, as Fox News took the title of most-watched network in all of cable television.
Racist Reid says what??….exactly
Any other Fox News related events you wanna cover?
Like Russia doesn't already know that?
Raskin is wrong.  He should've said "Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Aaron Mate, Rod Dreher, and Glenn Greenwald are pro-Putin, pro-Orbán, pro-autocrat propagandists.”
Fijate Glenn, por estas y muchas otras idioteces se asocia a EEUU con la decadencia y el fin de un ciclo. 
They are quaking in their lying boots. The truth will come out and their J6 committe will be proven a farce.
If you're against war, you are pro-putin
Glen a site seeing tour of the Capital will teach you where everything is inside the Capital.
you should sue Raskin &amp; Reid &amp; MSNBC for slander. Calling you a Putin propagandist needs to stop!
Why is El Humoncolo wearing a bandana durag? Rasta
Propaganda
I'm not sure if people who believe this kind of rhetoric from MSNBC are ever going to see any kind of reason.  Propagandized beyond belief.
If these fish will take this bait, they will take anything.
But when we look at actually security leaks, Biden declassified an entire safe room program because he wanted to sound cool on TV as vice president.  No complaints from the press.
What' the bandana for?
Dear God what does Joy Reid have on? The whole “reptile” look is not lost on us. 
Hmm? Carlson is a pro-Putin, pro- Orbań, pro-autocrat propagandist. Is that a contentious statement in Greenwald land? Must be that alternate universe the right inhabit.
MSNBC fascist fear-mongering. They oppose it because they cannot control the narrative.
So change the cameras. The videos belong to the people, taken in the peoples house.
Who’s the ninja?
omg they dredged up the old "Putin's playbook" line  
They're scared.
Aqui no Brasil a desculpa para não serem divulgadas as imagens do 8 de janeiro é porque mostrariam "informações de métodos, equipamentos, procedimentos operacionais e recursos humanos da segurança presidencial".
ok but the people in jail need to be released
They aired it in the unselected kangaroo court.
The footage should be provided to all news outlets. We KNOW Tucker will edit and only show what fits his and the Fox News narrative.
Liberal MSM had ZERO interest in covering any of the facts coming out of court cases of those being prosecuted for J6 protests, and definitely had ZERO interest in covering election wrongdoing uncovered by state legislatures, but NOW they want access to videos?
START CRYING
I watched the Jan. 6 incursion in real time.  The Capitol police showed the way to the safe rooms and on later surveillance tapes.  Delivery people, clerical help, janitors, all know where they are...there are no secrets in D.C....all is known sooner or later.
Tucker Carlson is not a Russian Agent.  Really, people, there must be some substantive issue you can talk about, like Biden's giving away Americans' hard-earned money to the very corrupt Ukrainian establishment, including the little dictator.
RIFKIN YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE
what is on his head?
What’s wrong with this guys head … ?
I don't buy it but if it were true they need to build another safe room.  The American public NEEDS to see all the footage and I'm happy it's Tucker that's going to report on it.  What happened to those arrested for Jan 6 "crimes" was insane (many FBI agents should be jailed).
Stigmatizing information and perspectives that discredit the GIN is employed whenever censorship, secrecy and sense fail. As so much has been made public over the last dozen years, the stigmatizing formula has become like a mantra, unceasingly repeated to keep the world at bay.
. Misleading and dishonest both of them.
That 2 shot is what I call a pair of deuces! FOLD
I agree this line of argument is absurd. I do however have concerns when something of this nature is shared with someone with a particular ideological bent alone. This should be disbursed across outlets not placed in the hands of someone with a clear position before viewing
Perhaps Joy Reid and Rep. Raskin should also comment on Nancy Pelosi's daughter filming and exposing the entire interior of the Capitol - where is their concern re Capitol safety, their outrage?
MSNBC has replaced the soap opera
one of the extremely rare cases that i'm rooting for the cancer.
This guy told his barber, "Give me the Moe Howard"
There are probably people on that film who played a role that needs to be subpoenaed to testify. I. E Why police removed barriers &amp; waving people in?Why did security details abandoned their post at key time they were needed to diffuse the situation?So many unanswered ?
Jamie got a free appointment with Joe's barber for the favor.
Is he a pirate?
Why is he dressed like a pirate? Guys can just shave their heads. Or wear tiny hats. He looks ridiculous.
Who thinks Russia doesn't already know? They got from Joe Biden's briefing to the CCP.
Why was only  Tucker Carlson chosen to receive the information?
I mean Glenn what’s wrong with making it available to everyone ? Why one network ? Because they want to control the narrative. What happens to you? You used to stand for something .
Cultural appropriation of a doo rag
You really shouldn’t judge journalists : it’s quite apparent you cater to your substake community and while you may believe you’re independent, you’re just playing to your room- question is do you know it or have fooled yourself
All they have to do is ask Joey
90 % of videos are police body cam and cell phone video. Why would Tucker give Russia anything?
"give it to all the networks"  According to Joy this isn't primarily about Russia or security, this is about Fox getting something that CNN and MSNBC didn't get and they're pissed about THAT. They should all have gotten it, but listening to those 2, it's like watching children.
Is he wearing his aunts head wrap or did his PR people it’s what will get him the most sympathy. Hope he beats it but that’s so weird.
Doo-rag man and Gladiator-woman spit fire before they enter the wrestling ring.
Jan 6 proved one thing for sure.  The capital building could be taken.   3- 80 year old KGB opps could take it by the looks of jan 6 security.   2 - ninja turtles  4- fuzzy headed cheo pets with nerf frisbees could take the capital
Why are there safe rooms then?
And what would be the problem with that?
Game Of Thrones Joy is my favorite!
Yep - right after the Red Dawn invasion happens IRL they'll know exactly where to look
Please unroll.
It's not insanity. Carlson has point blank said he's pro-Putin, pro-Orban, and pro-autocracy.
Didn’t we just learn that Tucker’s been lying to his audience for two years about the results of the 2020 election?   Sounds like the perfect, most honest and reliable guy to have access to all the footage.   Thanks, Glenn.  You’re a real man of journalistic integrity
It's the only narrative they have to avoid transparency.
Videos dont lie
Pelosi, McConnell and friends should have thought about all of this before the put the plans in place.  Tucker can do the job and not give away the "shop" so to speak.  It is more important that the American people find out the truth of what went on that day and who is at fault.
Glenn, what do YOU think about the dominion news?!? Did Fox News deliberately mislead the American public about the 2020 election results?!?   Not a peep from you about it bc it blows up your narratives.  Silence is golden huh?
They had two years to be on the side of transparency. They could have released these tapes to the public, or whoever they wanted, at any point but they chose not to- why?
We are going to find out the Jan. 6 Hearings were a Soviet-style show trial. All those that participate should be prosecuted!!!
I agree with you.
Lol this is comical. Do people actually watch this show and believe it's news? That's insane to me.
Russia bad
But that's good. DC is America's enemy.
Don't you think that the Kremlin has this information already?
What's on his head?
Tucker Carlson is a hate monger that Greenwald regularly supports and sanctifies through his fawning appearances on his show. Anti lgbtqi hate, flat out lying, anti semitic tropes, anti immigrant hate are all fine in Greenwald’s world, just as long as you are owning the Libs. 
Projection: coming from a communist in disguise
Msnbc is worse than cnn.
What's with the lizard dress?
“Tucker is a propagandist” Says the guy wearing a pillow case on his head sitting next to a shower curtain being used on a window.
So, you don't think Tucker is pro Putin?  I see clips of him saying pro Putin things.
Clowns are gonna clown.
I think the Russians already know.
"Pro-Orban"...that's odd to insert in there. Looks like Samantha Power really is in Hungary with USAID to try to stir up revolution.
Why is the guy wearing a baby mama durag
Journalist malpractice. They’re making half the country information hypoxic.
Adam and Eric already showed them enough
Is that why, really?  "Please get her fired.  Seriously … What the fuck? I’m actually shocked. It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke."
This is what Crazy looks and sounds like!
Fox might cherry pick the footage!
Tucker-Vladimir Solovyov and RT's favorite US "news man"...I wonder why..
Of course you’ve been instructed to say that. 
Video proof is the new propaganda?
As a free speech advocate, I support McCarthy releasing government info to one partisan news network. -Glenn the Guy Who Claims He Was Almost Killed by Bolsanaro
Clown World
Anti-White-Christian, inveterate prevaricator, fears truth. It will destroy his fictional narrative.
Did you happen to catch Chinas FM spokesman wenbin. I’d look it up if I were Everyone! They Declared War on US.
Look. I know Rep. Raskin is undergoing cancer treatment. But I'm beginning to think he's wearing that headscarf as a protection against any pushback on him at all. "Go easy on Jamie. He's fighting cancer." In the meantime, he's always been a train wreck, and that continues.
You seriously think Kremlin don’t know?
PS, nothing shouts #CulturalAppropriation like 's blond hair
COMPARE WITH RECENT CHINESE SPY BALLOON FIASCO.   28 JAN - 6 FEB 2023.  For a period of up to 10 days a Chinese spy balloon navigates from China to Alaska to Canada then across the entire continental US loitering over strategic nuclear facilities. https://t.co/556bBvbsWF
🤣🤣🤣🤣 How Insensitive. This Administration Loves To Smart Mouth People That Don't Like Them Or Their Policies.  They Go From One Crisis To Another Crisis.  Ukraine At The Top Of Their List. Not Ohio Residents, China Spying Balloon, Baby Formula, Services And Goods.
I don’t know but it sure is curious that in the restaurant I was in everyone had the same bruise! It could be connected to those balloons from mars and china!
Hi Why did you delete this?
Going to guess because that is his ash, from from Ash Wednesday.
Cool pic from inside a U2 at the China balloon.
It’s a balloon from China. https://t.co/b51Hlzlf9W
The real Chinese spies are attacking America from within. The Chinese spy balloons are an obvious infiltration into America. Less obvious, but equally perilous, is China’s role in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) movement. https://t.co/KwlSWkJH8Y
China has progressed from balloons to sea-borne eggs https://t.co/u0jWaBFvw8
“This is the same Trump-type tactics to question election results.”  Liberal MP Jennifer O’Connell criticizes the Conservatives for having concerns of election interference following a Globe report outlining CSIS documents revealing a PRC strategy to influence Canada’s elections. https://t.co/7oJXzTG5Il
Foreign interference. WEF.  Blantant I might add.
The NDP too
Obviously   is one of the eleven.
Well THAT explains why she’s there! I’ve never understood how the ditzy flake thinks she can pose as anything relevant.
I can’t even listen because of the voice
She reminds of this clip. "Why do you talk like thaaat?" 
Great Youtube Vid to help Liberal MP mature into adulthood!   Let's all give her support !  #cdnpoli #ElectionInterference #CSIS  #TrudeauMustGo  twitter.com/TrueNorthCentr…
When a liberal says this you know they are cheating
Honestly I’m not surprised that they are comparing this to trump election fraud, even though our case has actual CSIS proof.
kneepads must be getting threadbare she's hungry for the front benches lol
Don't worry we will keep asking and asking and asking.
“Because, Conservatives.”  Got it.
Typical joke!
I believe there "was" election interference! Not only the by PRC but also other entities! Retweet if you agree!  There should be a full investigation. Are not our elections one of the most cherished institutions in our country?
Which Barbie is this, now? Can't keep track.
I’m old enough to remember when foreign electoral collusion was illegal and punishable by the law.
I bet she has really smelly feet.
Lol, it's normal, don't worry about it!
Damn right it needs to be questioned seeing as things might not be the same right now like omg
Trump was right and so are we.
Silly blonde tricks are for kids.
Right. Because we should never be concerned about the integrity of our elections.
Add some more blonde dye to that head 
so YOU were one of the 11 then huh
—————————-
She talks and sounds like she’s 12
How embarrassed do you feel being a scumbag Liberal MP?
And those are the same Clinton-type tactics to rig election results, then feign indignation and outrage for anyone questioning them.
I think she needs to be investigated!
OMG that is one of our MP's? Being a Law Graduate and former clerk, she should appreciate the gravity of the allegations.
This is an unacceptable answer. . This is hardly the same thing at all, and you do Canadians an incredible disservice with your willful obfuscation.  Are you one of Beijings MPs? Or do you simply condone unscrupulous behaviour as long as it benefits you?
Why are the Liberals so afraid of any light being shone on this? Both parties are implicated in this technically it’s only the Liberals that seem to be hiding something
We know the drill, not falling for anything now. Liberals are going to try stealing the next election too. If they get that far......
Gawd I DESPIZZZES this....thing
Jennifer O'Connell  Rising star within the Liberal Party?  
Tass North propaganda
The remark was aimed at the original Con motion, which was merely Opposition grandstanding. Once the motion became serious, there was quick consensus.
Pfffff you’re not bothering to give ‘The Twinkie’ attention? She’s the MP for Pickering-Uxbridge &amp; is known as ‘The Twinkie’.
The election corruption in states like New York and California are so ingrained that they think it is normal
How fing original!
Nice try the government knew about the interference and sat on it because they benefitted . Now that they are exposed try and discredit the Conservatives .
I can see the whining when the conservatives win
Valley girl?
Settle it. Have ELECTION'S NOW.
Sometimes you have to wait for the proof from a viable source.
News: "CSIS report outlines election interference" Jennifer: "This isn't new, it's the Conservatives bringing it up now"  So we should just pretend it didn't happen and do nothing? Is that her response?
Wow. We shouldn't investigate foreign interference when it's not to our "political benefit"
Oh but if the shoe was on the other foot, I'm sure Jenn would be like...
Is this person an elected official?
Uhhhh....it was CSIS and Globe and Mail? Stepford Wife O'Connell strikes with smearing again!
This woman has the most whiny annoying voice.  No matter if you don't listen because I have never heard her say anything of importance in the house or committee .  And for sure not now.  Completely ignores the CSIS source.
This is nothing new. Um, yup when initially released the tried to deflect its impact. Now, with increasing evidence, they have no choice but to deflect harder.
Don't let them sweep this under the rug ... this is catastrophically bad, even by the low standards of this government.
These "Liberals" have Trump living in their heads 24/7  They were so concerned with Foreign Interference with the Convoy last year but when a Whistle Blower comes out revealing the possibility of Interference in Canada's 2021 snap election no one asked for, now it's no big deal..
Anyone in a government position who is not concerned about a foreign communist country interfering with our elections should be considered a traitor to the country and lose their job!!
#justinfied . That’s all, nothing else matters
She’s the worst!
I guess we know who one the funded MPs were
Ugh what the hell did I just watch. Good grief
OMG is she for real? This is supposed to be one of our best. No wonder the country is in the state it is in.
I am not curious to know your opinion about anything.
Derp! 
OH, the outrage against Chinese interference! I can smell it, taste it, hear it! Honestly, she has a whiny liberal voice repeating that it's 'been tabled' (without mentioning JT said he was never briefed on it despite CSIS briefings with him) and it's like nails on a black board.
I don't think she literally knew where the conservatives were then, she was still in high school.
Always deflect.  It’s what liberals do.
Well, there you have it, everybody. We can forget all about it because the Liberals say it's  "Trump-type tactics". Whew. I was worried for a sec there that our democracy had been drop-kicked by the Liberals yet again. Turns out I was wrong. Glad the Liberals set me straight.
Wow! I cannot believe the crap that comes from Liberals mouths. They spew lies because they know if there was another election, they know they are done! Too much corruption with them and NDP sold us out.
"this isn't new", they knew about it a said nothing. Yet so entitled that somehow that makes it ok.
they’ll say anything to try and change the channel
Is Jennifer O'Connell related to Marco Mendicino? They both have that glassy caught in the headlights gaze....
She is despicable and disgusting. Seriously! Trump tactics. This means that we can say, the Democrats' strategy to cover up treason.
How to say, "I'm one of the eleven" without saying you're one of the eleven. #TrudeauCorruption
It’s not interfering when our  team wins
omg, THE BLOND JOKES GOING THROUGH MY HEAD...
I’d really like to meet the people who voted for this lady. Must be a pretty slow population there.
Don't question our cheating...?
She is right. Love her.
It has and it will ,JT will not play fair
Lol. Ftard.
Haha  Telford using her special op's. Oh look the pretty blonde said something.
So, the excuse is "we knew about it, but the conservatives should have complained earlier and just trust us, it's ok.  Besides, it only hurt conservatives."
If Jennifer O’Connell was competing against 2 doorknobs on Jeopardy.....she'd lose.
Liberal liars.
She is probably one of the 11 Liberal MPs financed by the Chinese government.
I had to stop the video, something's off with her
Trying to deflect, what a waste of space this woman is.
Wouldn't it be interesting if she were one of the MPs that benefited from the interference? We should have no interference in Canadian society from Chinese dictators, so yes, inquiring minds want to know the truth. Nothing gto do with Trump BTW.
It's alarming to me that anyone would be bothered by people expressing concerns about the CCP interference in our federal elections in 
The liberal  comity fillibuster team.  Occonnell, Fergus, , Damoff, .
Trumps fault,  Harpers fault......
She sounds like she is 12 , couldn’t listen to her
She’s absolutely right to call this out.  It was only election interference that favoured the party that won.  Wr have absolutely no right to question the legitimacy of those results in a democracy.   
"Trump"  Samuel Johnson criticized William Pitt (the Elder) with the famous observation, "Patriotism&nbsp;is the&nbsp;last&nbsp;refuge&nbsp;of the&nbsp;scoundrel."  People throwing the word "Trump" like it's an insult that wins every argument are just as bad.
All elections should have a forensic audit completed by an *independent accredited* 3rd party   Liberals politicians are maneuvering themselves as above any scrutiny, above the law Not right  need to level the playing field so it's not 2 tier society political class vs the people
I don't know what kind of   drugs our liberal government members are using but I want some! I really wish I could live the happy oblivious life they all seem to be living.
Is this someone who purports to have an education and professional ability….and Talks. Like. This?  Awful.
CSIS said it. Also208,000 votes were not counted last election.   But don't worry election Canada apologized
Trump-type” attack is the kind of accusal a desperate communications team would do. What are you hiding liberals?
Well the document was leaked or they would keep denying.  Why is she so lost.  Lol
I’m waiting for the Canadians are racist card to be played.
So we can all agree that Russian meddles in elections as  well?
What's old is that the liberals have done nothing to protect the election process.
Hey Jen….
These criminals need to be locked up, that's all.
Nobody talks like that she chooses to talk like that because she believes she's better than most
She looks Alien
The residents of Pickering-Uxbridge today must be so proud.
Unbelievable,double talk!!
Shameful. No accountability
“Like they totally don’t like it duh” I’m waiting for the hair flip
Who voted for this beauty?
Like the ‘concerns’ peepee, steve his boss and the CONservative circus had when they sold parts of CANADA to the Chinese and the Saudis? CANADA REMEMBERS!
I hope this account is investigated. Where's the origin of funds for all this paid assistance. The Canadian people need to know.
What happened to Electoral Reform  ??
"Trump tactics"? I guess she forgot the 2 year investigation into his election in 2016, based on zero evidence.
Wow how was she ever elected.
Is she saying she's known about for for years and did nothing about it? Good politicians wait for in-depth reports from trusted sources. Then, discuss and investigate the issues, not shrug it off.
Pickering - Uxbridge press play and see what represents you.
Isn’t this same mp that embarrassed herself something terrible when talking with poilivre,I don’t think I need to say more
I don’t take vocal fry people seriously.
Jennifer is a liar (well she is a liberal so that is a given) I watched Trudeau deny being briefed about this by CSIS on numerous occasions in QP. In answers in generalizations. I think the whistleblower came forward because he was sick of JT not being honest about what he knew
Wasn’t it the dems that claims Russia interfered.
Trump like??????
Imagine if Canada had a fair election.
Trump style? Does Hilary accept 2016 yet?
Spectacular ignorance
This is the direct result of gender politics and not the merits!
As difficult as that was to listen to. Did she say that their not denying election interference and its really the conservative fault for not bringing it up quicker?
Ridiculous these people.
I ant believe my hard earned money allows you a job in this government.
I’m pretty sure I could coax a better response out of a helium balloon.
Airhead!
Sounds like Alexa
Who elected this lady? What did I just listen too?
She should question it.
#LiberalsAreDestroyingCanada
Canadians are not happy who are the 11 MP’s that is what we want to know
How is she even an MP? One of the 11?
The vocal fry is enough for dismissing her criticism
if even one riding had enough foreign interference to effect the outcome, that's one too many. Canadians deserve to know the truth about the extent of foreign interference in our elections, national, provincial, and local.
Her credibility.
And it's not just been brought up now it's been a topic in Parliament since before Christmas. Only now they have to admit it instead of denying it ever happened.
CSIS documents have been tabled time and time again?  Was the interference solved the same way as these?
Where have you been. CSIS says there  was interference, and so did your past MPs  and outside investigations
Is she for real, or a joke?
Painful,  we seriously need resumes, experience, auditions something seems like MPs are the bottom of the barrel scrapings
No, it is more Hillary Clinton-like, to question the effect of foreign interference, but nonetheless accept the result. It appears that Trudeau benefited from China like Trump from Russia.
Considering changing to a brunette…she absolutely gives blondes a bad name…ditzy broad.
So, now we find out it benefitted cons as well.  Pierre should shut his trap but he won't.
Where the heck does the LPC find their candidates?
No, her party is backed by China, all this deflecting and trying to blame the opposition? So weak. When she is voted out, I want the next government to investigate each and every one of these MP's finances and online presence.
She must forget the four years of russian collusion.  These people are tone deaf.
I think I lost brain cells listening to this.
"well the Conservatives, I guess are totalling not rad like us Liberals are ya know.".  I'm going to continue using the ladies restroom to avoid conservative men because their are only Liberal men in there.  Right hey?"
I'm assuming all the libs were helped by the Chinese, not just 11.
You are using Trudeau tactics to avoid answering and you think we can’t figure you out
Even China wouldn't want this one elected!  Wow!
How can anyone take her serious with that vocal fry
.. she must be joking..zombie in action..
Why are you still working from home???
"1 or 11"
What is SHE doing about it???…
Is this a comedy skit
Ok…where were you? You’re saying it should be non partisan and where were the conservatives? So I as again….where were you?
Stepford Wife
wow is she for real and she got voted in
The hair color says it all
Liberals make me sick.
We are all going to be questioning election results all the time. Get used to it.
This one is an empty vessel
O'Connell is one of the many dull spades in the LIEBERAL shed. But it's okay when TURD does the Harper carp for the last 8 years.
Lately, we aren't talking 2021 or older, now, I think his message and opnion gets stronger as the confidence grows on him, evolves together with his voters
We have nothing in place to take down traders!
Yet another example of how she is hoping Trudeau will take her into his group of preferred toys
Green hair covers for her fund source
 is a liar.
This was sent to me after the election
So she is communist China owned  Audit
Liberals condoning outside interference in our elections says a lot about how corrupt the entire gang of them has become
Wouldn’t it be hilarious if someone started a rumor that the freedom convoy was funded by the Chinese?!  I wonder what the libs would say then?
One identified who are the other ten??
Well, sure she’s concerned. Hasn’t been in parliament long enough for us to pay her a cushy pension after 6 years! Pathetic that we have criminals running our country……right into the ground! Would be so nice if politicians really did work for the people.
She must used white out on her computer screen to redact what she says.
Just listening to a call in talk show in woke Ottawa and so far 10 callers say nothing like Trump. Speaks to liberal desperation. One caller says he's more like Perry Mason. Knows what the Libs are going to lie about before they do. Correction 13 now. Phone lines jammed.
I’m concerned the any MP in Canada is not concerned about foreign interference. Keeping it hidden and opposing investigations is not good for Canada. It looks like a coverup.
I think any politician continuing to compare Conservative opposition to Trump style politics needs to be sanctioned and removed from office. In no way should any Liberal politician be citing that when we ALL know Obama had Trudeau elected.
The Conservatives are highlighting the issue brought to light by our own Nations security services. This serious type of information should be tabled often and dealt with, not hidden away because the Liberals feel it's to their detriment with elections looming.
Hey your talking sheet is incomplete.  Conservatives were warning about foreign interference in the 2021 elections last year.  Tell your scriptwriter to check their sources better next time:
How dare the public find out about the Chinese govt rigging the election for Trudeau, and how dare CSIS let the public that pay their wages know about it….   Leftie logic… Cheating is fine because it helped them 
Funny she doesn’t mention the 200k+ votes left at Canada Post that were mailed but some how were not delivered on time to be counted. Apparently those alone would have altered the results to a far smaller Minority Liberal Gov or a Minority Conservative Gov. An Inconvenient Truth
Considering that prior to both elections the Liberal party was playing the Russian bots interference, that's pretty rich....
Serious question. Is the entire Liberal government comprised of those who were always picked last in school for anything that had to do with intelligence or competence?
If knew about this and allowed it, it could be considered Treason.  downplays it and groups all people concerned about this issue (corruption and treason) as “Trump” like.  This is disgusting  and akin to calling Canadians racists, and intolerable.
That's because you used "Biden-Type Tactics To Steal The Election"...D'uh.
Oh my good lord !!! #election #interference what don’t the #liberals understand about #cheating with help from another #country 
Typical of this Party- the most corrupt, dirty, and dishonest group to ever occupy government to ever been given power.   They would not have a collective honest bone in there bodies!
Breaking:  China releases more footage from their Spy Balloon. https://t.co/BAdsoZd0kt
Ok. This is funny you have to admit.
Oh yeah!
Love It .
Something smells foul in the fish factory.
Is it a nuclear-armed stealth drone? A killer robot? Or a cyber attack that steals your savings? The truth is far more terrifying: a balloon from China! #Marxism #ChinaBalloon  https://t.co/ZY21OlITm4
Terrifying plot. These balloons are full of marxism powder and, once Biden pops them, it's gonna sprinkle all over the US and infect and zombify (or marxify) the population. Kinda like a gender reveal, but with communism.
Have you ever talked to the people spying on you in ur phone before? I do all the time. I mean think on this why would China need spy balloons when all they gotta do is point their satallites and tap into the system undetected. I mean #Illuminati eyes it’s because there are eyes…
BS..  His money has come from.  Why do you think the China balloon was allowed to cross the US? They never intended to tell anyone but it was discovered. He stopped all the sanctions. He says China is our friend.  Great day..
Now that nonsense is peaking. Saving civilians, if you honestly think that's what the West is doing in Ukraine, that is truly astounding. Washington provoked this conflict and when there was a deal on the table in March they shut it down since then over 100,000 been killed.
Exactly!  Ukraine &amp; Russia to a truce, until #ChinaJoe stepped in..
This just isn’t true. Do you have an article that describes this occurring?   Also calling him “China Joe” doesn’t make any sense, Biden despises China which is why he’s funding an enemy of China’s ally and signed the CHIPS Act to build American.
So did he get the GPS locations for those nukes from China flying that balloon over the US...
Actually only one of the balloons is confirmed by both Govt and the media to be from China (the one shot down). The other three we described differently, not a balloon, not from China or Russia or any other country and had no visible means of propulsion. That’s what the Govt…
US releases photo of China's spy balloon from above
The real Chinese spies are attacking America from within. The Chinese spy balloons are an obvious infiltration into America. Less obvious, but equally perilous, is China’s role in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) movement. https://t.co/5t8eNf2YGA
2/ and other balloons, the poll said.  About 55% of respondents expressed concern about the three additional balloons the US military shot down after shooting the first one and almost half of the respondents said they were sure the additional balloons were launched from China
Almost 50% of Americans do not trust US government on 'spy balloon' craze, a new Newsweek poll revealed.  53% of respondents said they are confident China sent the balloon for the purpose of spying and 64% supported the United States' and Canada’s decision to shoot down this
3/ as well.  On the other hand, 13% of respondents said they are not concerned at all about the presence of such flying objects in US air space as compared to the 60% who said they are extremely or somehow concerned, the poll added.  Subscribe to
"Tucker will tell Russia where the safe rooms are" is the MSNBC version of "balloons will tell China where the missile silos are"
none of my followers liked this tweet bc 60% were like "but the Chinese balloons were a threat!" and 40%: "How dare you excuse Tucker Carlson!"
Wait. Someone actually said that? Jesus Christ, I thought that was said sarcastically.
Watch the clip
Yer the boss.
Aw geeze.   "It's too risky giving it to only Fox. Give it to everyone."
*me, a Russian foreign intelligence agent, watching Tucker for tips on where to put the bombs*
I wonder what % of intelligence operations that countries partake in is either a complete waste of money that tells you nothing new or actively misleads you? My guess is intelligence spending is one of the worst ROI of anything in the world.
China is the No.1 violator of sovereignty and interferer in the internal affairs of other countries with spy balloons. Since the end of WWII, China has reportedly sent spy balloons over 40+ foreign countries, stole technology from other countries, and invaded neighboring lands.
The US is the No.1 violator of sovereignty and interferer in the internal affairs of other countries. Since the end of WWII, the US has reportedly sought to subvert 50+ foreign governments, interfered in elections in 30+ countries &amp; attempted assassination on 50+ foreign leaders.
What about all the coup of states afforded by US?
Well.. this whataboutism will sure open a Pandora box or can of worms for China. Don't even go there.
So first we stop the US issue (they came first), then we go for China.
No, Chines spy balloon came first who know how long they have been doing what over the skys of 40+ countries.
US is pressing the world with their rules since the end of WWII. China was a little economy until 2000, for God's sake. When China started "to spy" other countries, the US had already attacked Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Lybia, and the whole Latin America.
Oh no.. that's not it. Wait..lemme get the complete list.
sorry can't find the complete list of countries that the US attacked, that included Ukraine 2014. I could've brought that to your attention had the I not been blocked by that individual.
You are a pure devil 
how much is this tweet？ can i？
Balloons VS invasions and coups. Which is worse?
Tell Russia that balloons are worse than a land invasion.
can t compare with US
ma va a cagare
omg balloons. the horror.
And their balloons compare to the US how?
This is sarcasm, right?
Xombies with their flags showing up.
Stuuuuupid.
 boo!
Chiny Chiny  wszędzie te Balony no i zrobiło się wesoło 
And you are American, I believe. Whose land are you living in now?
You got me.   Hilarious
You've just raised the bar for my expectations of memes from you for the reply tweets that I am gonna post here for tweets 
We are all in this mess because of Victoria Nuland   and her Euromaidan coup in 2014
Find a few of Maidan activists and convince them. Good luck.
Wow SPY BALLOONS! Those evil communists from China. Do I get to choose between spy balloons or HIMARS; you have as your Twitter name? Guess what, I can't choose, the USA will always send its missiles to sovereign countries they deem as evil, with assistance of the EU, of course.
You betcha  the US will not rest until russia is weakened sufficiently.  These balloons jokes are just to taunt Chinese, as a side-show
Ukraine is nazi country
Well, that's news. You really are the very first human to say that since this war began  You deserve a pat on on the back for that discovery 
Hahaha  comrade, your brainwashed by western mainstream media.
Weather balloons. You’re a bot
真的，你们不要想太多，那只是个气象气球而已。虽然不知道他为什么飘了这么远。
A civilian balloon was inadvertently blown to the United States by the wind, and it was said to monitor other countries. Are there still fewer balloons that the United States has put into China?
What?
I think you can make up a story book for this balloon
It wasn’t a “spy ballon”. The U.S. has admitted it was a weather surveillance ballon from local enthusiasts. But keep drinking that kool aide.
But they didn’t killed in other countries many innocent people like the us did. But yeah, blind on one eye right ?
And how many people did China kill in foreign countries?
What a dumb response! If, as you claim, China are #1, does that legitimise the invasions and regime changes that the US have been involved in?
Imagine believing the us about spy balloons, these are just weather balloon dumbass 
buy a brain
Hey, im no fan of China but you have to be an complete idiot to even think what you are claiming. 
Abominable CNN, so many people turned into monkeys

It's Not All Balloon Buffoonery: Weaponizing Anti-China Paranoia https://t.co/mZgPiYSy2A via
It looks like a Balloon to me!!!!
The satellite is like this: Well, move the moon! I'm a star here now!
Thanks for the article. A bit rambling but some good points. I find it fascinating the sort of hypocrisy re China vrs Russia of mainstream journalists. MSM very often gives Ch a pass while almost foaming at the mouth regarding Russia like some echo from the Cold War.
If more Balloon Baffoonery floats over the US, our Baffoon leader might find a use.
Silly article. Protecting our airspace from unannounced, uninvited surveillance crafts is always a good idea. It’s not paranoia, it’s common sense national security.
Well balloons been over USA before tracking us and can't really say about at least 1-2 of these balloons. Always better safe than sorry. If President Biden had done nothing people been complaining about that too.
Where Hollywood ?
Medicine
Our Government and most major institutions are compromised by China.  D.C. needs to be removed from the picture with a Convention of States.  Like Yesterday.
🚨#BREAKING: The Pentagon has just released high resolution images of a U-2 pilot flying by the Chinese surveillance balloon  📌#UnitedStates | #USA   The Pentagon has provided &amp; confirmed authenticity of these impressive, full resolution photographs of the Chinese balloon from… https://t.co/OoLj2TP6ye
Probably the top comment on our yt video about the balloons . That and balloons vs balloons 
Thanks, I'll check it out later tonight
We should have shot it down as it approached the Alaskan coast. We have an absolute clown in chief. He either does nothing or waits until it’s too late. This is total incompetence on Biden.
#ChinaTrump
Pfffft what do these people want with "facts" /s
Balloons balloons…so many balloons.
That’s the most photoshopped thing ever lmao
Well, these are real pics.  Most likely a video grab.  Would be hard to time the plane's shadow on the balloon so precisely. Lighting looks accurate too.
I don’t trust it, that means they made edits to the picture. To me it’s not 100% legit.
Why fake it when the technology exists to take these shots?
Why wait 3 weeks to release it?
because the government works slowly and photos like these have to be analyzed to make be sure nothing top secret is being shown
Exactly you said it all 
You are still explaining the definition of editing a picture. 
Yea… come on with the shadow 
Now let's see the other 3 UFOs they shot down.
Where’s the UFO pictures?
China sent back this high resolution image
Those are your beloved “satellites” in “orbit”.   Technically anything above 50 meters above the earths surface is classified as a “space station”   Crazy how words games are used and so many people are deceived
For the millionth time: THE EARTH IS ROUND
... I like turtles...
I like budder
You’ve got to ask yourself… what’s happening in the hand they don’t want you looking at?
Multi-million dollar spy plane equipped with the latest and greatest camera sensor technology and all we get is an iPhone selfie?
What about the one that was off the coast of Hawaii earlier this week… where’s that one? They just hoping no civilians saw this time or….?
knew it was a Chinese spy balloon and still let it transverse the entire USA. What do the Chinese have on him and his family?
"it didn't compromise national security"
BBC said the selfie was referred to as "legendary" there's nothing legendary about flying a plane next to a balloon.
They want the clout 
Fair enough. Where are the photos of the other objects we blew out of the sky?
Those escaped from a birthday party.
Ok... HOLD ON just a minute.  A U2 spy plane. Has an incredible camera/sensor array on it. But they've given us a "cockpit selfie."  Why is that exactly?    Certainly a U2 isn't made for an airborne interdiction mission (IE, go fly up there and see what's up).  Interesting choice
This is all the peasants get. I’m sure the feds have better.
IKR, the hell with us.
Lol the shadow is reversed on the last image, what in the photoshopped is going on here
it’s the same image.. just zoomed in.. wtf are you smoking
Mini Space Station
And yet they don’t have pictures of the other UFO’s shot down? 
Looks like their estimates of 200ft diameter were fairly accurate.
#Bantiktok before it’s too late!
Hand feeding us tiny bits of information.
Bet the don't show pics of the other things that've been floating 'round lately.
I was there in person when they shot it down. I watched the last 2 hours of flight. It was not that high. Maybe 20k -25k feet. I could easily see it. I fly planes, so my estimate is pretty good. Didn't need a high altitude plane to get close
It came down at the end
It came down detonating
it was less than half the height it had been at it’s highest when they shot it down.
Ok what about the others?
Do you all know that every single satellite looks like that ?We don’t actually have anything in space because we live under a dome! NASA is the largest purchaser of Helium in the world for a reason Don’t believe me ? look it up !! Don’t believe the dome part? read the Bible
Here’s one of the recovered images. 
Why not release the other object photos as well?
They should release the intercepted signals. Was it spying or trying to communicate for navigation 
Closest view yet
Thats a lot of solar panels for a weather research balloon. Thats about 5-8kwh array at rough estimate.
Have you ever notice how NASA has balloon recovery technology and could of recovered the payload intact?
Of course, they do, of the balloon. Where’s the UFO pics?
But can’t bring out high resolution pictures and videos of 911 GOT IT
Nice pictures, where does it say on the equipment made in USA?
That balloon flew right over Oakridge Tennessee. Hint hint wink wink bop it twist it aaaggghhh
First thing I thought of with the fire there.
If it wasn't where they literally build nuclear bombs I'd of dismissed it too as an accident but those don't happen there.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence, Steve you know, like all those other ones
That ain’t no weather balloon lol
They also released a warning for our service members to not consume baked goods with poppy seeds #LetsGoBrandon
And China wants people to believe it was a weather balloon
P h o t o s h o p  
So why are all of the UFO pictures blurry AF then?
zoom In on the U2 cockpit. That things nasty! Someone needs to detail that thing.
It’s funny cause it’s actually far more sinister than the fake video of the balloon with a camera on it going around.
Nah, those are size JJJJ breast implants.
Looks like they stitched the plane into the image?   Thinking we’ll get photos of the other ones is probably overly hopeful..
Conspiracy Theorist you are!
A flying flame thrower would eat that up cheaper!  was it silk? 
Satellite...
It is my belief these are the real satellites that are retrieved and put up again. I hope more mess ups occur and all sat's are exposed in the coming years.
China isn’t messing around.
Evidence of negligence by ..... nice.
The U2 hasn’t flown for decades.
Wrong. Stay in your lane.
Hmmm... but they didn't do a close flyby like this for the $12 hobby balloons?
Haha it's basically a budget satellite 
This thing is superior to a satellite in the case that it can hover, whereas a low earth satellite cannot. It is relatively low in atmosphere whereas can monitor radio frequencies close to the ground.
They both have their advantages I suppose. I actually had a very similar defense concept.
I cant believe the band U2 shot the balloon down, This will definitely up ticket sales!
That it was ;)
Why waste all that money on gas sending a U2 plane to look at the balloon?   I just used my telescope and phone camera 
It looked back at you! 
Meaning it was live!
All noise!!!
What a waste of tax dollars.
Whatever man. I like your stuff but be realistic. They fly training missions all the time. It didn’t cost anything extra.
Here is the video if you were wondering.
How are we still using those things? 
These pics are crystal clear but the UFO pics they give us look like they were shot with a Nokia flip phone wth
Hahaha thanks for that
“Full resolution”?
China so ghetto they can’t get their satellite in orbit so they just attach a balloon to it.
Notice the flat horizon?
Spy satellite on a budget.
Satellite wars been on for years my dude
Looks like a flat earth campaign if I ever saw one.
thats not high resolution 
Dannnng.. Can’t believe Joe destroyed those panels, we could have repurposed those for something.
Scary to think about why the Chinese boldly went on this surveillance mission and how much Intel they were able to gather. Why now? You have to think it was mission complete for them. Now talks of visits with Russia. Not good folks
They sent a spy plane and all we got is a picture from the window?
Their economy is in the tank and getting worse…probably trying to gain leverage to do business with USA and get their economy turned back around
Crazy how, even at 50,000+ feet of elevation, the horizon rises to meet the eye line
Raptor missile said whattttt am I about to blow up?! A balloon ?? But it’s my babies moms birthday 
yeah if that's a "weather research balloon" I'm a Biden voter.
Seen this one this afternoon very concerning.
Ok cool now show us the pictures of the UFOs we shot down shortly after the Chinese balloon!
“High resolution” images?   They’re pretty grainy…
We still fly them to this day what are you talking about 
Maybe by “we” he means him and his tinfoil hat
I just don’t believe anything from the pentagon.
Haven’t seen any of these?
The problem with a Chinese Balloon … Once you shoot it down with an F-15… Your hungry again 15 minutes later…
"Country with spy planes flying around the world asks the world to please clap because they found an alleged spy balloon"
But not a picture of the three other balloons they sent fighter jets to shoot down . Something seems off
Any U2 photos of the $12 hobby balloon before launching $1/2 million in missiles at it?
The Oakridge facility has Uranium fire and a few wks ago we had this. Coincidence??
Great job disney studios! 
Now release photos of the other objects
Clearly a weather ballon.
Thanks for the great updates 
It took them weeks to come up with these photo shopped images?
The shadow on the balloon is overkill…
58kW solar array. That's enough to power 5-6 homes!!
Oh ya I completely agree that this was someone's personal balloon..... Not!!!!!  Can't believe they tried to pass that off as civilian 
Now the pentagon needs to release photos of the other 3 ufo’s
Remember when the pentagon failed to spot a “rogue” plane that easily destroyed a specific section of the building by amateur pilots? And now they can spot these “foreign balloons” ? Definitely an inside job. Just saying.
Saw exact type on a tiktok that had crashed in jungle I’m guessing like Taiwan
A lot of (couch) military and photography experts in the replies now. HAHAHAHA.
Earth looking a little flat 
What is that for left cable tied to?
Weird how the UFO ones are never good resolution, but when it fits a narrative then it is crystal clear
The ballon was attached to a satellite?
But they still won’t release the full gimbal video and all the other high resolution videos of true UAPs.
I want to see the photos taken by the U2 camera.
A U-2 pilot is an American pilot.
Yeah I saw that earlier today on Twitter
We wanna see them UFO pics
wait, so how do you think you are using twitter right now?
Space balloons and flat earth refraction duh
Ummm. Yeah we have.
Lmao.
Lmfao, they still use 30 to this day ....hard fir you to internet today isn't it.
Lol, they gave it their best shot..
Remind me how close to the plane the sun is again?
Seems like a hack Photoshop job. Lighting is off
No wonder solar panels are so expensive. They’re depleting inventory by using them on balloons instead of buildings.
So the satellites aren't in orbit just above clouds
Don’t make me laugh.
Like I'm going to believe anything I hear from the Pentagon 
Jet Fighter:
That’s amazing. What a view. It looks like a tether really did break. Heck, they are probably over there sweating like crazy, possibly chopping heads off college students for this. They don’t like failure. No one does. I bet they are telling the truth somehow. Really nice design.
Nice pics considering the u2 probably flew by at close to 400mph.
Bono! That pilot fighting balloon!
Yea it's a weather balloon
Clown ‘President’ and administration
LOL. What about the mysterious 3 that we "cannot recover"?
What about the balloon you reported that was spotted near Hawaii?
So this is what high resolution images could look like. Image if the high resolution UAP images were released. 
Looks like it has 4 motors with props. They were flying it, steering it where they wanted it to go.
Doesn’t look suspicious at all. Let’s have it sweep us from coast to coast.
Good Gosh Almighty!!
Damn the comments in this thread are not what I expected
It’s crazy to think that the U2 was developed in the 1950s and are still flying to this day
That. Is. So. Cool.
Damn that’s big
Real big
Dude, that's my house right there
Why does the shadow of the plane on the balloon look backwards than what it should be?
Real?
I thought it was a hobby lobby balloon?
It’s a balloon with a satellite attached!  Why does China need those when there’s heaps in space already 
The shadow of the plane on the balloon is a bit much.
yeah.. weather balloon my ass
The current pentagon and authenticity don’t go together.
Finally released it after it was already leaked!  Lmao!!!
Odd to use  BRIGHT WHITE on a spy balloon 
But they still can’t find the who planted the bomb on J6 
Who cares, everyone knows what a balloon looks like
How about the other objects they shot down! Crickets
China and Russia are planning against the USA,  we need to be ready to defend ourselves.  This are different times and our two party system are failing We The People.
Who was driving? Bono? The Edge?
Space is fake. And ghey
Yep, even says made in China when you zoom closer
Yea that’s great.. where’s the others?
I’ve already seen a pic of the balloon.  This picture is exactly what I thought it looked like when I saw it smaller.  Why does this continue to be news
Anyone believing this?
How do we know it’s Chinese?
Weather equipment my ass
This is the real pic, don't buy their propaganda.
China. Thats funny.
I thought it flew too high for a plane to get close it?
It was a U2 pilot....  ...but he still hasn't found what he's looking for
That’s no weather balloon. Weather balloons and instruments are much smaller than that.
Doesn't look very high resolution to me
how the fuck did we let this happen ?
but we still haven’t seen images of the UAPs
Ya not chinese surveillance,  just regular old satelitte that failed because there is no space cant get through the firmament these balloons are to high to see and bounce off the firmament. See same thing this pic has just been photoshopped by nasa
Clearly photoshopped, they didn't even do a good job
Like they don’t have experts who can change things around and make edits we don’t believe it
Looks like a satellite
So we took pictures of them taking pictures of us
That could be the band U2, for all we know.
Nice selfie
I’m calling this
Think they would show the site they launched from or the huge hangers used to store them?
What happened to the one spotted near Hawaii ?
iPhone or Android
That's good......covid in the balloons from China, love it!! Glad you are doing this in the upcoming episode, I can already see that it's going to be great!
Ok china balloon syndrome  Could have been from the Yukon or northern bc  I mean, but the news that Chinese were doing more business here  Was conveniently apparent just before  So forgive those good snake rejecting whoresuns  Who believe it comes from the top  And ebby is weak

I don’t understand why China would do this.  They unleashed Covid on the world. No response from the United States.  They literally send spy balloons into our country. No response from the United States.   They don’t need warships. Just tell Biden to bend over and he will.

Well we got more info on China from the balloon then they got with the balloon soo
It wasn’t a China spy balloon. The fed knew exactly what it was and that’s why they didn’t tell you and waited until it was over water to shoot it down and collect the debris.

Interesting. Was that spy balloon really China's? Read this article from 2019.  https://t.co/grSWNB9lkV
Who does the US really not like? Russia. Who is Russia's ally? China.  Is the US setting the scene to justifying future 'action' they decide to take?
During the first security dialogue by senior officials from the two Asian nations in four years in Tokyo, Japan and China also agreed to facilitate mutual communication in the defense field amid a spat over suspected spy balloons flown by Beijing.
You missed three spy balloons from China and you personally attended a briefing by the Biden administration telling you missed it.

Balloons, Bureaucrats and Bloviators.    This week’s episode is centered around transparency and the growing distrust for the U.S. government. Available tomorrow on and https://t.co/2Yv0qRElGI
I'm looking forward to it. 
can’t wait for a clear view in these tumultuous times !
Sounds interesting.
Watch the YouTube video “Hello Kitty in Space.”  14-year-old girls are more than capable of sending balloons like that up into space.  There must be scads of them.
Sounds like a great upcoming show, I will be tuning in, thank you
That's funny about what you are waiting for Trump to say. I bet that's exactly what he is thinking and that you nailed it! Will definitely be tuning in tomorrow to get your full take on things.
 but don’t quote that guy… ever.
I really hope it begins with “99 luft balloons” …
That's good......covid in the balloons from China, love it!! Glad you are doing this in the upcoming episode, I can already see that it's going to be great!
Will definitely tune in tomorrow morning! Anxious to hear what you have to say about all of this.  All of the government's faux pas and spy balloons too. I am pretty sure I have seen that movie before!
You are no longer relevant!
I always welcome your voice!
Governor, maybe it’s time to start talking about how horrendous the state is running now!
This is great
I have a iPhone but know nothing about podcasts.
The blue Bull &amp; Bear tie by
The chemicals that were released in the ocean and atmosphere are not good for the environment.
Looking good !!
Remember that time you killed seniors.  Lol fun.
An arsonist talking about fires caused by arsonists.
Hi, I’m Andrew Cuomo, a rapist, wife cheater, abortionist &amp; so many other distasteful characters. I ordered covid patients into aged parent homes which resulted in 1,000’s of deaths and I want to be taken serious again with my own whittle podcast.   Just Go away!
Only one of the above three men signed a lethal bail reform bill into law.  Can anyone guess who?
Andrew, you nailed it!!
After your decision to force the elderly inside of their nursing homes and the subsequent massive amount of deaths that followed, how in the world do you have a podcast???
Who are you?
Andrew, after your disaster in NYS heres some advise:  Stick with the Meatballs.  New Yorkers are sick of you.
This podcast is excellent!!
Why does anyone want to listen to this guy or his brother. They are a disgrace to the United states. Whatever they say more than likely is a lie.
Bloviators?Now there's a word that calls for clarification.Isn't this what Politicians do on the regular??Let's get real.its a Yabba Dabba Do typical rhetorical language all its own.The general public is tired,scared&amp; nauseated in the lack of integrity.Where's the honesty anymore
It is astounding to watch this Nineteen Eighty-Four of you. Do you know you resigned in disgrace? Do you know you have 11 accusers? Did you read the devastating report by Letitia James? You’re a joke, and you’re oblivious to that fact.  You exist in oblivion and do not know it.
Arrest after arrest this year, including now a hate crime, and back on the streets thanks to Andy’s bail laws
Go away.
You’re the biggest bloviator out there
So you have a podcast on the distrust of government. How many grandparents did you kill?
Says the sexual predator
Lmao you used the power you had in state government like an over sexualized mobster. F outta here you hypocrite. 
Cuomo and Kennedy are the worst names in politics one was a chump in bed with the mob and the other used one for political gain and tossed her away
Omg you are fantastic. Who says you don’t have a sense of humor. Disinformation? Good Lord he is such a horse’s butt!
#mypoorgranny. 
Sadly, you are part of the reason for the growing mistrust in government. You abandoned our seniors and you took advantage of young women.
Go away already. FFS
Go away pervert
Says the man who was a chronic liar and corrupted as governor of NY.  Stop pretending you did not contribute to this.
You are a terrible person
An petty politician like yourself
Can you NOT just go away!
how many elderly have you killed this week Cuomo ?
And don't forget about the State government- which you started King Andy. Now Bucky is the latest tyrant
For 13 years NYS leadership has not addressed the issue of over the top emissions from unregulated indoor situate wood boilers.not acceptable wood burning but NYSDEC was told by someone to back off! This affects wood burning allowing these devices to operate without controls
You might be the only one of those three that deliberately spread covid, killing many of your elderly constituents. Shame on you
You’re one of the ones I didn’t trust. I moved out of NY because of you. I spent my entire life in NY and you destroyed it. How many Grandma’s and Grandpa’s did you kill and get away with it.
Your a P.O.S. playing all your Covid games &amp; You caused Many Deaths Go AWAY
Mr Cuomo do you see what these fools in the state of New York The state that you ran pretty well granted you had some issues The place that your father did such great work and they want to take his name off the bridge I'm sick of these people
You killed my mother. Fuck off murderer.
Shove #Fredo back up yer arse. Ogreish lookin kmart ass supervillains.
You’re a real cock sucker.
I'm amazed at how many sheep still like you.   New York state is in free fall because of your policies.   New York  is losing its  population. New York leads the nation to "zombie homes"
If that was Trump’s response I wouldn’t be the least surprised.  Just so damn stupid!
What a dipshit you are!
Can’t wait to watch, love your podcasts! Thank you, always an interesting and well thought out take. You’re sorely missed in NY, I’m from Long Island and we miss you being in charge. We are afraid with the incompetence and outright stupidity that pervades now.
Blow the whistle
I forgot to tweet how much I loved the Dark Sky. God how I needed that book. Hey Dean,Hey Gerta, stuffs happening big time. Pennsylvania found pipebomb on tracks, number of derailments, yep, food factory explosions, balloons from China, bombed Russia pipelines, yep, day is fading
Q: Do you meditate or have a favorite type of exercise?  A: I enjoy meditating about all kinds of exhausting exercise routines.
earthquakes so frequent in middle east, over 7,500 after shocks, it blows your mind. Strange lights occurring before Egypt quake, blue sky,  yep, stuff is happening. I listen to a Messianic Jewish man report on news so get really good info on the rest of the world. MSM sucks.
Yeah, trump was so tough that China expedited Ivanka’s TM apps &amp; granted her TM registrations.  Balloons flew during the trump “presidency.”  So putting migrants in cages &amp; separating kids from families secured the border?  Biden didn’t GIVE inflation.
Aaron Rodgers emerging from his Darkness Retreat. https://t.co/5jYSGuckad
U have to be insane to think it was a alien 🛸 ufo. It was a balloon from China period
Narrator: in fact it was three spy balloons from China.
Yes. If you could see balloons from the ground, then it was huge that for away. Not the size of a bus. Get real people. Goverment keeping faces from us. China is laughing!
Biden’s war in Ukraine is a gift on a beautiful platter to China.
I think it's another a spy balloon from China 🌝
CCP declares it won the COVID war; Debris from downed Chinese spy balloon taken to FBI lab  0:31 CCP declares it won the COVID war and created a miracle 1:54 Chinese billionaire tech banker reported missing 3:48 US completes recovery of debris from downed Chinese spy balloon,… https://t.co/qvJiRxrpAt
That's another weather balloon from China. Shoot it! Quick, shoot it! Before it finds more naked photos of Rubio, McCarthy, Gaetz, and McConnell.
A mysterious iron ball nearly 5 feet wide was found on a beach in Hamamatsu City, Japan, this week. Its origins are unknown, but authorities are investigating.
Putin...."He started it" Biden..." No. He started it" Putin..." He is a Liar, He started it" Biden... " I don't Lie, or tell Porkys" Putin..." We have Proof, from a Balloon" Biden..." We shot it down, prove it" Putin..."That was the China one"
What’s stopping the Chinese from putting biological agents or nuclear weapon on one of these balloons? They could spray biological weapon and blanket a swath of the US. With distrust in US gov, I wouldn’t be surprised if our gov attacked citizens and blamed China.
Ban Communist China from buying farmland next to military installations.
Where was this Tweet when Trump was in office?
He tariffed the F out od CCP. Lefties are on that TDS crack again.
They shouldn’t be allowed to buy land anywhere in our Country! And all land they currently own should be confiscated!
Marsha what is the Republican plan to stop digital currency?
Ban Communist China from buying U.S. farmland. The End.
Why they hell are we selling land to China in the first place?
Secure the border
Ban China from buying ANY land at all in the USA!
Which digital currency?
Such a ban should incorporate a minimum 100 mile radius.
Ban China from buying ANY US Land!
How about any farmland?
Isn't that we hired YOU to make sure is done? To secure our nation... Why is it politicians always wanna tell us what needs to be done. We the people already know. It's why we hired you. Get to it.
They shouldn’t be able to buy ANY farmland!
Ban buying our farms to all none Americans
Or anywhere. Why do they need to own land in our country?
What and where is said farm land that is being sold?
How about making MEGA hats?
Ban them from buying any land at all
DEFINITELY
Any land.
You mean like in Texas and North Dakota? Both of whom are run by Republicans?
Ban all countries from buying US soil
How about banning them from purchasing farmland PERIOD!!!
Ban Communist China from buying land in the US.  There I fixed it
Why is this a question? Stop them now and reclaim land
Why doesn't the military buy the farm land if it's that critical?
Write the bill.
Tell your Republican Governor.   Red states been selling it for over a decade now.    Red State Greed.
Add bill gates to the list of people not allowed to buy farmland.
All foreign ownership by our adversaries.
They should be banned from owning any farmland in the US or Canada
Hey #MoscowKaren, you’ll need to talk to all your MAGA racist farmers about this - they’re the ones selling it
That should be a given.
China owns a lot. Literally. They own America now.
You voted against it 3 times, to ban china.
Ban former presidents from having bank accounts or paying taxes in China.
Looks like Colorado is banning black people from owning farmland. Maybe you could check into that.
Stop them from buying American land PERIOD!!!!!
Yes, but when we're at it, let ban Saudi Arabia from owning oil refineries in America
Ban You from the Senate! Traitor!
Don’t let them buy any land.  Allow them to only to sign short term leases and make that very difficult.  Conservation enforcements in place with strict regulations, no new infrastructure, no cutting cutting down trees, no dumping, etc. Yearly audits and foreign ownership taxes
Ban them from buying any land!!
Will you SHUT UP?????
You may have to ask Ivanka Trump if she’s OK with that
Why are military installations next to farmland? The military is by far the biggest polluter and destroyer of the environment.
Says the woman who is on a list of being one of the most corrupt Congressmen in the country
Agree.
Still waiting for that town hall…………..
You do if!!Rite a bill, solve a problem instead of just tweeting about it
Why just China? And why just farmland?
Ban them from buying any land in the USA!
No other country should buy land here, it’s stolen land, selling it should be as much a crime as is buying it.
Ban them from purchasing land at all.
You can do that Marsha. It takes an act of Congress. So a member of Congress, say yourself, would have to write a bill, get other people to vote for it, get it to the other congressional house to be passed. And bring it to the president. Do you think you can do your job, Marsha?
China should be banned from buying any US farm land.
Why haven’t done so?  maybe they are receiving bribes like trump?
Tell that too your Republicans in Tx
This again?
Grand Forks North Dakota just halted a land purchase from China near their Air Force Base. By the way, University of North Dakota enrolls many Chinese students in their aviation program which is also close by.
Ban people from selling it.
Just stop Chinese nationals from buying land on US territory, period.
I don’t even eat Smithfield products anymore!!!!….never knowingly buy anything the brags ….made in China….
Why did you let it happen in the first place the last time you had GOP majority and Trump was President??
Give it to hemp farmers
Next time Communist China comes around looking for farmland around here, we'll just have to tell 'em "No, no, Marsha said no."
However, it's okay for Saudi Arabia to own the largest oil refineries in America. Do you remember that 15 of the 19 terrorists who attacked the Twin Towers on Sept. 11 were of Saudi descent and were bankrolled by the Saudis? You forgot. I won't.
ban China from buying any land anywhere in the US
Question. Why are farmers forced to sell their land?
From anywhere in the USA .  If there is a valid need they can lease the land
Why don’t you create legislation that will pass instead of tweeting about it?
Earlier this week of Republican state representative David Eastman, who attended the January 6, 2021, rally in Washington, D.C., suggesting that children dying of child abuse would save the state money in the social services those children would otherwise need.   Ban Republicans.
I actually agree with you on this one but
Gosh Marsha, if only you were a Senator, who could write a bill, with legislation forbidding China from owning farmland.  Instead of only being someone who just tweets about it.
From buying land in America
Foreign ownership of US farmland doubled from 2009 to 2019. Why have you not spoken about it until now?
Not just there, EVERYWHERE in the USA.
So now you are going to tell land owners who and who they can't sell their land to? Sounds like you are against free will....
It's a free market Marsha 
Well at least you don’t have to worry about those pesky drag shows anymore.  The ladies at your next tea party will be so proud.
Ban them from buying land in the US period.
Are you ever not day drinking?
You not getting enough kickbacks?
This is the MAGA GOP. Squawking on Twitter asking US to do THEIR job. 
Ban Marsha from Social Media. Maybe then she might do some actual work, that might justify the salary the American taxpayer gives her.
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha SEE? We CAN agree on things. This is actually a good idea. Now…read the room and drop and the Trump crap…focus on this and legalizing Weed!
Then let’s do it then.  Ban from buying, ban from owning at all taking back what they’ve already bought.  Also, include a ban on taking over, buying, owning any American company, like Smithfield meats which they’ve already taken over.
Hey can you define a communist Chinese in the US ??
Ban them from buying any American soil.
Yes, or anywhere else in this country. Do we want them to take control of our food supply?!
Where is this happening Marsha?
What happened to banning China from buying land in America?
Can we ban Russia from Buying DC Senators too.
ANY land within the USA!
Stop talking about it and DO IT
Marsha you really should come up w something else.  We all know Trump loves China and everytime u tweet about Biden not being tough on China....all it does is remind everybody that...yup..Trump loves China.  Hector Projector.  Yawn.
Saudi Arabia owns our largest oil refinery (in Texas) and they are pumping unlimited amounts of groundwater in Arizona. If you’re concerned about this, maybe be concerned about ALL of it.
Would you prefer Russian oligarchs buying farmland next to military installations?
This is the 6th tweet by today and zero of them have to do with improving the lives of the American people. Just yammering and conspiracy theories.
From 2016-2020, you said nothing. Why wasn’t this an issue when Trump was in office? By the start of 2020, China controlled 192,000 agricultural acres in the U.S., worth $1.9 billion, including land used for farming, ranching and forestry, according to the Agriculture Department.
Ban Seditious Insurrectionists from serving in Congress!
Start by supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. That will send a message to China. Or, you can just speak to Mitch. I hear that his wife has connections to China.
Okay, consider it done !
Ban them from buying ANY land in America. There, fixed it for ya Marsha.
How about we ban imports from China as well, including Walmart crap. Maybe champion the American blue collar worker for a change, Marsha. Ever think about that? Didn’t think so.
Do you have that thing on repeat or something? Can you come up with something different?
Are you still on about this?  All of your constituents shop at Walmart. All of them. It’s China’s greatest clearinghouse for goods in USA.
Ban ALL congress members that tried to overturn our fair elections
Show me where. Show us on a map. If it's in Texas with or in your district I think Chinese should buy a house next to you. The rest of the country no.
Or not, whatever. Blah, blah, Marsha, blah, blah, blah
Were your MAGA hats made in China?
Says the Russian agent
You never said anything while they were buying farmland during the criminal Trump’s 4 years.   Why was that?
How many times have you tweeted about this this week? What are you draft some legislation that could be passed into law to prevent this? Why must you stir up fear with all of your divisive rhetoric? Need a town hall in Hamilton County, it's been 6 years, we demand it, now
This guy owns a lot of farmland and our largest refinery. Is that okay? Why don’t you criticize the Saudis?
Ban the CCP from buying any American land, anywhere.
Ban Communist Trump from having bank accounts in China.
Gettin lazy Marsha...seen this one,so...
You tick every box...
Ban them from buying any land PERIOD!
Ban them from buying ANY land in the USA

Ban Communist China from buying LAND. ANY land.

Ban China from buying anything in the US
Yay communism
Prosecute everybody who tried to overturn an election.  Start there
Or all US farm land!!!
Any land period.
Yes!!! It’s unacceptable!!!
GOOD IDEA!
Should go further, including residential and commercial properties, as well as any business of strategic importance.
Blah blah blah #GOPClownShowContinues
I often wonder what's beneath the farmland. Geologically speaking.
anywhere in the US.
Ban anyone from buying farm land next to a military installation who doesn’t pass a security background check? I mean it’s not like there haven’t been American spies, right?
Why are you telling/asking us? You’re a lawmaker, figure it out.
Ban Communist Blackburn from taking Campaign Donations from Opioid Manufacturers.  #MarshaTheMurderer
Or anything at all!!!
Did you stop it under Trump?
THE ? IS....HOW ARE "WE" GONNA GET BACK WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT??? AND WHY DOES BILLYBOY GATES NEED FARMLAND?....HE'S JUST A COMPUTER TECH....OR MAYBE WE NEED TO ASK STEVE JOBS ABOUT CANCER CAUSING AGENTS INDUCED??????
Send China a warning, you hook up with putin and ALL TRADE STOPS.
6th tweet today! Aren’t you on the Senate Commerce, Science &amp; Transportation Committee. Jurisdiction over rail for instance? There must be something you could be looking into …rail regulations?
Any land in America.
No farm land anywhere in theUSA NO EXCEPTIONS SEMPER FI
Hmm if only there was a government body that could introduce legislation to do that.
Ban them from buying any land in the USA.
Ban from Congress.
Why not ban all farm land from Chinese ownership.
You are bloody late to are fired.
Go ahead
Ban people from selling their property next to military bases to the chinese.
Ban Senators from taking money from big lobbyists (domestic &amp; foreign) for favors
How about ban any purchase of land by any foreigner.
Do your job Marsha! Get a bill together. Don’t bitch to us about what you should be doing. I don’t want China buying US farmland, so I’m telling you. Stop tweeting every few minutes and do your job as a Senator.
Why don’t you ask the Americans selling it to them?
Ban China from buying land.
What are you doing about it?
Ban all foreign governments from buying land…. Other countries do!
BAN EVERYTHING  Conspiracies and danger are everywhere
Maybe you should try to help your farmers and maybe not be so proud of Tennessee being the largest importer of China imports?
Maybe for... (the third time) you have one good idea.
Ban Women with Beehive Hairdo's from being in public too, while you're at it.
How is this not already a law?
Hey guess who owns that farmland? It’s not Democrats selling farms in North Dakota and elsewhere. It’s also not democrats selling oil refineries to Saudi Arabia.
Foreign countries or individuals from other countries should never be allowed to buy American land.
In Texas???? ABBOTT SOLD HIS SOUL
*any land, farm or otherwise, anywhere in America.
I thought you didn't want them to be able to buy any? What's up have they donated funds into your next campaign?
Ban them from buying land. They're making enough of their own in the south China sea.
Banning for any land in the USA period
From buying any land
From buying Farmland anywhere.
China use slave labour to build their warships? Then sanction those Chinese warships and prevent US warships from engaging with them, even in the event of war ...... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
US Navy Secretary Deltoro said that China has launched many warships in recent years, because China "is using slaves as warship workers", and the US lacks such "advantages".  Senior officials lie at will. Kind of pathetic to see America today.
So the Biden administration tracked the Chinese spy balloon all the way from China, allowed it to traverse the entire continental US without shooting it down, and is now shooting down random objects we can't identify...and these are the adults in the room https://t.co/XDMsN23OCv
Lol you just won this argument. Don't bother him. You would have to be an 1d1ot to think a standing president not visiting the site of a major environmental disaster was ok while at the same time chastising the former president who is showing up.
Don’t send me your shitty article, Trump let many fly over and as usual, didn’t do shit.
Biden’s DoD is shamelessly using an anonymous source to say that Chinese balloons flew over the US under Trump - and the Trump team allowed it.  It is a lie. We never heard this - ever.
Elon do we have protection from EMP’s in America? And if detonated from one of those balloons would it wipe out the population? Asking for a friend ☢️☣️ My friend doesn’t have good feels about China and Russia and Iran ? Thanks for your Time ! Can’t we all just get along ?🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Falcon 9 and Dragon rolling out of the hangar at Launch Complex 39A
They did, the current story from the state department is that they were informed by China when China knew the balloon was going to fly over mainland USA
China had made it clear that the entry of a Chinese balloon into US airspace was an entirely unintended &amp; isolated event due to force majeure.
did  inform  of the #Balloon before  found it? #ChineseSpyBalloon
Ban China from buying any American soil after the balloon incident.
Falling down stairs Giving money to foreign countries Letting illegal immigrants enter from southern border, norther border,  &amp; ocean  Allowing his CCP buddy to fly a China Spy balloon across the country from one coast to the other Doesn't do a thing for the Americans in Ohio
Where's Biden?  Kicking ass and taking numbers.
Wonder if THESE SPY BALLOONS FROM CHINA ..has their TERRORIST that come FLOATING over our BORDERS doing these things! Train wrecks, industrial explosions, etc. 🤔 🎈🎈
Republicans would have started a war with China over balloons! Biden’s calm sane reasoning  based on intelligence from America’s National Defense and Security Departments approach is crucial for peace and handling any crisis.
People wondered what China's balloons were for?   Was signal for Biden &amp; traitors to start their attacks from within.  Impeach Kamala Harris and Joe Bidden by end of week! And transportation/  fema secretaries.
Emergency services respond to uranium fire at National Nuclear Security Administration complex in Tennessee
Trade associations encourage members to reshore or otherwise diversify production away from China in wake of alleged spy balloons - https://t.co/Q3Rc3QxzGw - via https://t.co/IFfMh5qjlZ
Didnt the US administration say the balloons came from a private company not China?
… it could force them to fire large salvos against multiple targets to get an appreciable result. And China may be more hesitant to escalate like that, it's different from nuking a single location. Plus we gotta improve posture for a pure conventional fight anyway. 13/16
Funny, apparently, we saw the spy balloon from China all the way here
CHINA DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY OR MILITARY! AN EMP BLAST FROM A BALLOON WOULD WORK. WE WOULD ALL BE IN THE DARK AND OUR MILITARY RENDERED HELPLESS. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT?
An EMP from a balloon wouldn't be enough. The area of effect would be too limited. It would need to be a high yield ICBM at around 200,000'.
Watch the EXPERT that Dan Bongino has on his show tomorrow night
I've been reading about this and studying the problem for years. A balloon doesn't make sense, except for maybe somewhere like North Korea.  But if a high yield bomb were detonated a higher altitude, it's estimated that 75-90% of Americans could be dead in 3 years.
China doesn't want to destroy our country bc it needs our resources. I'm not suggesting this is a plan, I am saying it's a possibility.
They would have already done it...Things are Not as they seem.
China’s weapon. Take away our ability to get stuff
BREAKING NOW: Several reports of an unknown WHITE POWDER OR DUST SEDIMENT falling out of the sky throughout West Virginia and Maryland..  Local fire departments suggesting people shut windows and doors  and stay inside until it can be investigated..  https://t.co/leLX62SpcT
Save some for me
It's what was in all the Chinese Spy Balloons we shot down, lol. 
But it happened in Michigan too the other day. One citizen showed “snow” flakes  on his nice truck- the clear coat lifted and bubbled/peeled up, another lady was sitting in her hot tub, white “snow” flakes fell but clumped together &amp; fell to the bottom of the tub and didn’t melt
Oh wtffff
Interesting that the administration is all in different countries during these times
Your fact meme is completely incorrect have a nice day
Do NOT mess with it.   PEOPLE!!! NOW IS A GOOD TIME FOR THOSE DAMNED FACE MASKS! THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE GOOD FOR!
I wouldn’t be out in it touching it or taking pictures smh 
can you provide more prof than just large letters pretending to be fact? The can’t find ANY remotely close to what this says
Proof that he DIDN’T visit any derailments? Can you find proof that he did? Also here’s proof he’s directly responsible
That’s not proof! The train didn’t even fall in the category including the new breaking crap..
Yes it did.
It's a dust storm.  It happens.
Dust storm?  The ground is soggy wet and we actually have grass and greenery.  We don't live in the Sahara.
It’s from a dust storm. It’s not anthrax
We don’t have to worry too much about West Virginia. Most of em have genetic problems already from inbreeding.
Just hear me out… maybe its a advertisement for Cocaine Bear  the movie did just come out!
In the 80’s, this would be heaven.

Someone needs to contact this guy and get him to test what that white powder is. I would collect some with a mask and gloves being careful not to get any on your clothes put in in a very clean glass jar hopefully with a glass lid tightly sealed. Keep this substance out side.
NO DIFFERENT WHEN MOUNT ST HELENS BLEW IN WASHINGTON IN 1980 AND COVERED 4 STATES WITH ASH!! I WAS IN MONTANA AT THAT TIME AND THE ASH LOOKED LIKE A FINE DUSTING OF SNOW!! NOBODY DIED FROM IT

Now that they have us resisting the mask they poison the air.

#UPDATE: We think this was from yesterdays dust storm that was in the parts of New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma as weather satellite shows large plumes of dust blowing across the states and making its way to the east coast
Any update on this?

Acid + ? = Salt
Aliens? China balloons? Aurora Research Programing? Planes from Idaho dropping chemicals? I mean the list could go on…
Pollen in North Carolina and Virginia it's really bad and coats our cars.
Looks like south Alabama pollen season to me
I think it is called “snow”
Looks like HCl fallout from East Palestine, similar to photos taken then
And to the US, from Biden: Overall CPI: +6.4% y/y Fuel Oil: +27.7% Electricity: +11.9% Groceries: +11.3% Chicken +10.5% Milk: +11% Eggs: +70.1% Bread: +14.9% Potatoes: +12.4% Baby Food: +10% Airline Fares: +25.6% Real Average Hourly Earnings: -1.8%.
I had white powder on my car and in the driveway last week. Evidently it was reported in upstate New York and they claimed it might have come from Ohio. Upstate there was also an odor
We. Are. Under. Attack.
Tagged Like 25 minutes ago I was going to comment on the pretty dire strategic situation I believe we are in as well and provide supposition that I believed a secondary chemical weapon attack might be imminent. And now...
This is just new marketing ploy for Cocain Bear
Nothing to see here,  just Trump's fault,  move along.  That's what these people of PA and MD get for.. wait.. what did Joy say?
What the hell
Oh my gosh!!
Saharan dust....
We get that too
Balloons dispensing fentanyl..
Snow. 
It’s all joe biden! 
Is anyone testing this?
Rub a little on your gums and let us know how that feels 
Waiting I’m Northern WV and I don’t see anything
Did one of hunters bags fall out of the plane?
Drones now have the capability of dropping anything from a far distance and has become a weapon.The things we create for good some use for evil. Watch as everything gets worse month after month and year after year as Bible warns about the last days.
Prolly not a time to joke but I’m gunna let it fly… does it melt when you warm it up?
If they really think its from EP, they should probably try to stay away from it.
WTH is going on?
Snow???
Looks like WW3 playing out differently than what people imagined
Climate lockdown
Our weatherman said pollen counts were really high where I live.
Where is this ?
What Now … 
Cocaine Bear marketing ploy
Climate change
What in the actual
Here we go...
Scary! I had a dream the other night a helicopter landed on the baseball field spraying something.
The coating on Dogwood leaves?
Hmmmm, west of Ohio?
Raining cocaine! Biden’s America #GiftFromHunter
I’m on the west coast and I saw the same thing.
Its fallout from Ohio 
Cocaine Bear was based off a true story . Didn’t say it was whether it was a future story or not
I feel so safe with Biden as president.
Stay inside...maybe wear a dust mask until more information is available.
Oh it's just from the dust storms out west. 
Don't worry, Hunter will be there shortly to snort it all up.
Turn off hvac. Cover vents
A possibility? From 10hrs ago...
What a surprise.
Source?
Balloon 
#AcidRain
Probably from the fires in Ohio.
Uh snow?
What now, FFS
We will probably all have "3 arms" before it is all over..
What parts of West Virginia? Is it just the Eastern Panhandle?
Roll up a $20 and have at it.
We had 11+ inches of white powder fall here in the last 24 hours. Luckily, I have a white powder blower that I use to clear my driveway that took care of the problem.
Just like I've been saying that ash is going to come down
Probably fake news
Whatever the heck has been going on lately I believe it’s all planned!
The devil is a liar, Chaos agent and spreads hate
I have been using my inhaler more often and washing white dust stains off my car in Connecticut for two weeks. #EastPalestine
The firmament is breaking down. Lol
This is happening right now in the DC suburbs. Appears to be dust from a storm over Kansas and Oklahoma yesterday.
Either grapple snow or could be from some of the fires from the plants, oak ridge uranium fire is along the jet stream to those areas. Or it’s just wet coal ash from train derailments. It’s been way too long since OH to be it since that blew along more than 10 days ago.
Pos Bidens fault
Its pollen. My flowers are starting to come up, Easter lillies have already started to bloom. Yellow forsythias are blooming. Grass needs cut. I have never seen spring this early.
Came from Arizona
Damn glad I'm out west right now.. THIS is All just getting CRAZY 
I am in MD
Imagine this fallout is falling on crops and livestock as well. Stock up buttercup
Wtf  omg 
Little plastic pieces???
Did the cocaine bear sneeze??
The highest cancer causing chemical known to man
What’s Hunter Biden doing in the sky 
is this a weather event?
Don't worry, we sent out a pro to investigate
Pretty sure that’s aids
 I'm waking up to ash and dust I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust I'm breathing in the chemicals  I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus This is it, the apocalypse 
White powder, you say?   Welfare you say?  #ZelenskyWarCriminal ....comes into the chat
 No doubt related to the Ohio incident.
Volcano dust.
Snow??
Dust storm from NM,TX &amp; OK  Dust particles stuck in the clouds
Relax!!!It’s just hunters Cocaine….%10 for the big guy!!
That's NOT a good thing...
I GUESS ITS NOT SNOW.  we are under attack. but from whom?
Its called SNOW!!
Now is the time for masks perhaps.
Did Mitch McConnel yacht blow up?
The sky is falling, the sky is falling!!
nuclear winter.  ByeDen predicted it.
Ash Wednesday?
That's it! Another $110B to the Ukraine then.
Also west New York, southern Ontario, and Virginia. Bust out the tin foil hats folks.  2023 is already a bust.
That. Um. If not snow. If I didn't know better, it looks sorta like fall-out. If you do not know what fall-out is, remember to keep looking at this, and then think of Nagasaki Japan.
Is it snow? 
Hmmm, wonder where that came from.
DIOXINS.    Look up Mike Adams on Brighteon.
That's my jeep
West Virginia ? Could be fly ash from a coal fired generating plant
Awfully funny too that the temps going to drop and potentially “snow” in some areas after spring like temps today. People will think this is snow at first glance.
In the South we call it dirt
Sounds like nuclear fall out
could be oxidized chemically
Snow?
Don't go outside..
One of these days it'll be anthrax from a chinese balloon.
Chinese balloon aliens!   Can't believe nobody knew that. 
East Palestine leaked two chemicals used to make PVC ... they probably combined in the air, now you have what looks like PVC fallout ...
Chemical-laced pollen courtesy of Norfolk Southern 
Looks like when the forest fires rain ash all over here in WA. Which didn’t happen my whole life in western Washington till about 5 yrs ago and is the new depressing norm. The world is fucked.
EAST PALESTINE, OH. (dioxin) let's pray  church...
EAST PALESTINE, OH. (dioxin) let's pray  church...
I had a dream several nights ago that something g white and powdery was being spread around to kill people and animals.
Pollen
East Palestine. The radius for the sediment is ridiculous.
If this is marketing for Cocaine Bear I gotta admit it’s pretty good
I’m sure whatever it is they will say it’s Trumps fault.  Maybe from the Chinese weather balloon.
We call that desert dust here in Arizona although this looks much more suspicious and toxic and most definitely not normal for that part of our country. Please stay safe!
Tennessee uranium processing plant fire fallout? Happened a few days ago. "They" said it was contained, but who knows these days.
Depopulation.
Been said that it’s dangerous to by the way
Nothing in Baltimore but light rain.
What about the alloy plant that just caught fire 3-4 days ago in Fayette county WV?
I'm guessing it could be carried from this high wind. We have white sand all over here in NM.
Is he one of these unidentified balloons that are supposedly sent from China?
Let's keep making jokes about this guy. We can be better than that.
C'mon man.
Is he part of your pack?   
from the perspective of asean countries - which was the country that achieved military supremacy in the past and decided it was a good idea to invade &amp; occupy most of asean region? i'll give a hint, it's not china...
As indicated by the next Ukra!ne will most likely be Japan. Taiwan will probably just welcome the PLA. Japan would love to have Taiwan as their colony again.
Hahaha  security for Asia-Pacific......  America  please leave  ....soon....the sooner the better for our Asian countries.
Also, it’s crazy for Japan and its American masters to think ASEAN will turn its back on China, which is its largest trading partner  Japanese and American plotters overdosing on the copium
Has anyone forgotten Japan’s New Order and Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere initiated by Kishi during WW2? With new Axis members US, Australia and NATO, will more ASEAN members submit like Philippines Marcos? History has short memories.
They still dreamt of this.
ooh yeah..that will go down well...Japan is much more hated than China. Shot my wife's grandmother in front of family. Had apendicitis. Lying on floor. Jap thought it was a joke to hide a rifle. Murdered her.
HST down almost 18 percent from near time high since the balloon incident., #usa #China #Balloon the battle of systems and global lead, be it economic, tech etc will never stop
War would never end, when the weapon of western countries and Russia ran out by order from puppet governments orders. Then deep state and CCP China will take over western countries and Russia CCP sent spy balloons around the world? These puppet gov never want to investiage more
NOPE.  INDICT BIDEN &amp; HIS SON HUNTER &amp; HIS BROTHER WHO HAVE TAKEN $$ FROM COMMUNIST CHINA &amp; OTHERS!!  BALLOONS RING A BELL?? 😎✌️
This photo of #China's #SPY #balloon taken from a U-2 reconnaissance plane is absolutely bonkers (video) https://t.co/rTVd8MH2sO
1-2) Who didn’t know an attack against the U.S. was coming? If you didn’t, you’ve chosen to ignore the obvious. I’VE STATED: “balloons” from China (who’re allies w/Russia) not only spied but released something.
2-2) I don’t profess to be a prophet but I KNOW WHATs COMING because I watched &amp; listened to our enemies &amp; …ALWAYS keep your enemies closer than friends, this is a generational war strategy that works.
👀 “The Arizona senator co-founded a balloon space-exploration company named World View in 2012. Just two years later, he helped facilitate investments for the firm from Chinese tech giant Tencent.” https://t.co/7uBlzYDXiF
Never did like that guy
Lord, help us
Another democrat traitor.
Even if he did who will you do anything about it. Do you actually believe the DOJ would investigate?  We no longer have Constitutional law in this country. Dems do as they please. Conservatitves go to jail even when they don't commit a crime. J6 is an example! Rep R useless!
Mark Kelly does nothing for Arizona. A Biden rubber stamp.
#BalloonBoy
And yet Arizona put that lousy pos in for another term.
From Chinese spy balloons in the sky to spy buoys in the sea   Might be best to leave the beach ball at home the next couple of weeks 😀  #China #spyballoon
US is spreading sfairesphobia 
Agree and learned a new word today  Had to look it up
US submarines going to start shooting torpedoes at the buoys soon
Changed my Twitter name accordingly 
Canada has become the 51st state of the US now.
In 1958, US carrier "Boxer" performed several high altitude tests using helium balloons. The seventh of which used a 1.7 kiloton nuclear warhead, detonated at high altitude causing a far reaching nuclear EMP. Something to remember as we target "weather balloons" from China
OMG! CHINA!!!😱 I am trembling in fear. I am on the beautiful island of Taiwan. Only 160 km from the mighty CHINESE!😩 PLEASE!!😭😭 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Please bring your own balloons for the party!🤡🎆🎈 https://t.co/21NC8nX0UF
First of all let us get back to today. China's economy is not doing so well after years of ZERO. High jobless rate. "Let it rot" "lying flat". Tech companies bye bye. No microchips! Healthcare failing and housing bubble. US experienced in battles. China???
既然中国像你说的这么垃圾，很快就要崩溃。那么美国殖民者在害怕什么？为什么一听到中国这两个字就吓得直哆嗦？
哈哈哈哈。如果你不害怕就不会在这留言了。既然你是台湾省人，为何不用中文？装什么假洋鬼子？如果台独分子不害怕，李登辉时代就修改法律成立台湾国了。（那时候台湾省人均GDP是大陆的25倍）为什么不成立？躲到中华二字后面装孙子，充的什么硬货？
Not scared. Only posting to piss you off. You can keep talking about the past but now here in the real time we can all see the CCP...
你不用跟他说话，他是一只五毛狗，发推赚钱的，不用想着挽救他，让他死在茅坑里算了
I know they are in the Chinese propaganda rooms. I like to give them sh!t and laugh at their stupid comments of daydreams and their version of history!!
Can you explain the spy balloon from china. Biden is coward
Not really, Defending your country is not stupidity. Democrats morons think Africans are fools
I told you she's considered stupid. And yes, Republican is the party of racists but go on...
Stupid are democrats practicing lesbianism and abortion
That shouldn’t affect you at all. Point blank, homosexuality is a culture of the USA practiced by members of both parties. You really should read widely. With a closed mind, you won’t know so much
Today Jill Biden is visiting Kenya to promote Lesbianism and abortion
Now this is something a closed minded person would say. I bet you said the same about Obama in 2015  Our laws are very clear on homosexuality.
wake up blackman, CNN and ABC news misleading you.
Yeah right
Brainwashed black think Trump hate Africans. CNN misleading you my friend.
I told you to read widely. I read.   By the way, now that Trump loves you, why did we witness lot’s of black protesters under Trump? They were celebrating his love for them?
What’s there to explain? He shot it down. What next?
Can you explain the spy balloon from china. Biden is coward
I don't tolerate nonsense
You can still be intolerant to nonsense without insulting anyone. It takes a small mind to spew insults any how
Why do all democrats love Lesbianism include you blackman?
You didn’t answer this!
I need my Ohio Answer
If you don’t read: you won’t know much. First, Trump rolled back regulations that protected people from these disasters. Train transport is a devolved function and the governor refused any help from Biden . If you can read
When will Jill Biden attend your gay wedding????
Why neglect Ohio Disaster ?????? Biden is an idiot
Again, check your language. You claim to be a Christian. That idiot is the president of USA and there’s nothing any of us can do about it
China’s Spymasters Can Get More From TikTok Than From Balloons.  More on BLOOMBERG  https://t.co/5KqosHmLrx via   #China  #ChinaSpies https://t.co/i7A72DI7lB

China sending balloons over our country, and now harassing our military pilots over the South China Sea, international waters. But we keep sending money to a failed war from Day 1 in #UkraineRussianWar. By the way #UkraineWillWin if Russia decides to give up, that’s the only way!
Balloons from China !! Where is Epstein's list ?? Kind of like how they showed Johnny Depp's stupid trial instead of Epstein's girlfriend the child groomer trial ?? Are so child like that we are that easily distracted ?? Where are the children from Epstein's Island ??
China will try to dominate headlines at G20,after balloon saga China is on complete diplomatic tourism from Russia to Ukraine. https://t.co/lHzvOMrkgu
#UkraineRussianWar  “Ukraine's Zelensky wants to meet China's Xi Jinping to discuss peace plan”  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he plans to meet China's leader Xi Jinping to discuss Beijing's proposals on ending the war in Ukraine.  - via
Tibetans in Nepal were the former ruling elites who oppressed Tibetan serfs, ofc they are angry that they lost their power. But ordinary Tibetans in China are enjoying their liberation from serfdom, so stop trying to disrupt their lives. https://t.co/2PD45q3yHM
I met many Tibets in Nepal while living there &amp; NONE of them were happy about China occupying their country and NONE celebrated it!
And you do NOT speak for Tibetans!    The Tibetans I met in Nepal were NOT the ruling class &amp; you should avoid making assumptions about things you know NOTHING about.
Stop trying to sanitize the brutal overthrow of Tibet by the Chinese.  Some of those living there now MAY want it to stay as it is.  But China did not then nor now give them a choice.  Don't rewrite what happened.  ANd China has a VERY sh1tty record on human rights.
NO, USA have atrocious human rights record, PRC have lifted 800M citizens out of poverty, you can buzz off with your fake activism.
Dumb question. With all this technology we have, satellites etc., if these balloons came from China, how were they not detected earlier on? It's looking more like a hoax from Canadian and US government to keep the fear going!  #TrudeauMustGo  #BidenWorstPresidentEver
OK. Answer my ? first. How is JT destroying Canada? Be specific.
Of all people Johnny. If you have to ask this question I'm going to have to question your intelligence.   #TrudeauMustGo
FFF SAKES. Just answer the question. Your silence will speak for you.
Why would China need balloons with all of their satellites over us?
Good question!
Or to distract is from other events.
Exactly. But that might make me a "conspiracy theorist"!  #TrudeauMustGo
No way !
it's was a silly hoax... Like you said with all the technology out there, why would the Chinese need to use a huge balloon ... it's laughable.
Could be war on the horizon Aliens, or the end of the world, but they sure got us guessing lol
It must be difficult being you?
Can you screen shot this supposed attack on his wife please Johnny. I would never attack Sophie. I actually admire her strength for leaving her abuser.  #TrudeauMustGo
Good ?…now what actually happened when balloonswere flying?  Besides jt handing out more $$, not standing up for ians, ( I have no tv for news) &amp; be fk’d if I’m downloading ctv/global on my phone
OR....they were just American (Pentagon owned) balloons specifically designed to spy on Americans?
I certainly wouldn't rule that out either!
Why does the CPP need balloons to spy on us when they’ve got Trudeau? The funniest part was when Trudeau said he ordered  the US Air Force to shoot them down. I laughed so hard
He looked ridiculous when he said that!  #TrudeauMustGo
That would be more plausible than them making their way all the way from China to Canada without anybody noticing. But of course common sense doesn't exist in Canada anymore. Only the highest level of a nonsense for the Canadian people
Just like these UFO's. They can pinpoint you with satellites, but somehow these UFO's were missed. People are so dumb
even dumb questions can be asked - just don't fall for those conspiracy theories.
“World War III is looming.” Since he has no vision, or policy, or record to run on, Trump tries new campaign tactic: he’s going to try and scare the hell out of you. He reeks of desperation, and it’s just plain pathetic. https://t.co/CY659gYWRv
By pretending he’s a balloon from China?
How would You respond to Ted Cruz ??
All we've heard the last few days from American media and government is "China will supply lethal weapons to Russia", the fear was instilled in the public and now the President clears the air and tells everyone what's really happening:  https://t.co/WaftBsxsVk
I wonder if an average American considers which is worst, spending so much time and resources on foreign policies to protect freedom, or allowing their domestic affairs regress to the point when basic necessities cannot be met to support freedom.
What a brilliant question Kang! I’m going to use this tweet in my livestream this evening!
Agree Cyrus its a gem! : )
Most people elsewhere can see through his charade.
I have a feeling this will become a self fulfilling prophecy. They will just show evidence of the quality of Iraq had wmd’s and the people will fall for it for the nth time. They will act on them, and then, well, this is basically a direct threat of “you are next” so…
Antony Blinken is far too hawkish.
U.S. politics now is a hot mess.
I hope they meet and have a conversation.
US diplomats stir up trouble and then the President elect (means any president on borrowed time) has to correct it. Talks about not being on the same page. What's going on here?
They wanted to take the wind out the Chinese peace plan
didn't stop them applying more completely unnecessary sanctions to Chinese companies. tit for tat China should blacklist some US companies now.
USA politicians are not trustable.
clearly the US politicians just like to lie.
Meanwhile, American M1 Abrams tanks, American Javelin anti-tank missiles, American M777 howitzers, American Bradleys, and American HIMARS weapons are being supplied to Ukraine
“US supplies lethal weapons to Taiwan?” 
Yeah sure, I don’t think we have 31.6 trillion dollars in debt 
Even Ii the Chinese are, it's completely legit as well.
A lie is halfway 'round the world before the  truth has got its boots on.
You had me when you said Biden clears the air. The guy can't even navigate a flight of stairs.
Why doesn't the USA government focus on it's own house, which is apparently on fire and under water at the same time?
I would argue Chinese arms sales to Russia are inevitable as a consequence of fact that the West is trying to force a defeat on Russia that will create immense pressure on China.   No one believes this diplomacy stuff now, and the West has been hostile to diplomacy all along
Muddying the water: this is a dance between the establishment and deep state and their media mouthpieces. Nothing more. I will continue to ignore all of them and form my own opinion about the motives of American military state.
North Americans... 
Blinken heard that wrong. China was considering providing legal assistance and not lethal assistance to Russia in the wake of the banditry West’s threat to seize Russian foreign reserves frozen by the West
The viewership-driven MSM must reform or they would die like dinosaurs in the face of OpenAI and open source news. I recently signed up to only get my news from 1440. anyone knew about them?
It is sad/bad that Americans are so easily manipulated! News?!  Even the BBC spreading anti-China. Ads in LA area for Shen Yun say it is the wonderful culture of China before communism! China has said they will not provide weapons to Russia. Let's see what happens. GROG
China is neutral most of the time.
All western media are pushing the bi- dictatorship's (Republican and Democrat) propaganda. The fact is US of Atrocities is likely to start WW3.
Love it when Joe goes 'off-script' and does his own thing! #PeaceNotWar
They just keep on pushing these Sinophobic psyops. It's always the same thing; float some boogey man story about China, doesn't matter if any of it is true. the damage is done.
The US has been sending weapons to Taiwan. Not only weapons but military personnel as well. So?
Biden has decided to defeat nuclear war capable Russia and China, who are now strong allies, and he wants to defeat them simultaneously. That’s best evidence for impeachment based on wrongheaded incompetence putting our nation at risk of destruction.
Sounds more like political muddying of the water so that the biggest military powers of the world can further accelerate the obscene arms race they have created &amp; imposed on the rest of us poor buggers! 
#Washington's orchestration of #Russia's "unprovoked" invasion of #Ukraine is going so well that they are busily planning #China's "unprovoked" invasion of its own province of #Taiwan. U.S. troops and weapons are going in. Never mind 50 years of the U.S. 'One China' policy.
The gun-paranoid warmongering Anglo-American species - the only criminals never brought to justice for committing a myriad of heinous crimes against humanity...their racketeering administrations /corporations have used money/deceits to justify their crimes from time immemorial.
These people never quit.  They ought to STFU at this point.
Says the country who just sent spy balloons and lied about it. I would advise against believing anything from China’s tyrannical leadership.
Imagine someone being so dim-witted that they think a $12 balloon had spy equipment, a navigation system, a motor, flew at 60,000 feet, and propelled itself from China.  It looks like an asinine deflection from his treason. https://t.co/JeoYUs5Lmu
So a spy plane, in the South China Sea to spy on Chinese activities in their region with a propaganda team from CNN on board?  Thank goodness its not a Balloon, or they'd have to shoot it down to match the US precedent set over the past month.
It's not illegal to reclaim land from the sea to develop low lying islands or reefs.   Vietnam and Malaysia have done it in the SCS too.   Sit down war propagandist. The State department has you shilling for every war the US starts.   READ A BOOK
"20 othet countries (including Brazil, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam) insist that military activities such as close-in surveillance by a country in another country’s EEZ infringe on coastal states’ security interests and therefore are not protected under freedom of navigation."
You know South China Sea doesn’t belong to China right?
What right does that give the US military to surveil Chinese territory IN the South China Sea?
Found the fool.   Learn what “international waters” are.
US aircraft intercept Russian aircraft over "International waters" all the time.   Or is what you're saying that "some animals are more equal than others"?... Fool.  The Russians and Chinese just don't have propaganda teams from the MSM on board to feed idiots like you
Looky a dummy trying to change the subject!!  All capable nations do this.   You asked a specific question.   Don’t cry when the answer reveals your ignorance.
You'll find that - as usual - it's the US military complaining of "unprofessional intercepts" of their spy planes to generate media buzz. With actual media teams on board to amplify their message.  Since when are intercepts of surveilance jets and bombers controversial?
He’s from fucking BOTSwana hahaha irrelevant
It wasn’t dumb to shoot down balloons. It was a case of fuck around and find out. If the Americans send balloons over China then they can shoot them down and show the world. Until then, we only have evidence of this behaviour from China.
Bad laws, rules, policies and sanctions=&gt; today’s Inflation in the U.S. and Europeans.  Why would business owners be blamed?  -:)
I told myself to shut up  but I am saying this again for the world peace and the best interest of American people! I could be wrong but I doubt it this time! -:) 
Apparently I see know future deliveries from China balloons no parts for the school buses, for the near future.
Despite launching 464 Long March rockets with satellites, the US was frightened by one out of course weather balloon from China. They forget China has also launched a Moon and Mars landers/rovers. China's space station is doing well. Congratulations to the Chinese space program.

That would be more plausible than them making their way all the way from China to Canada without anybody noticing. But of course common sense doesn't exist in Canada anymore. Only the highest level of a nonsense for the Canadian people
Just like these UFO's. They can pinpoint you with satellites, but somehow these UFO's were missed. People are so dumb
even dumb questions can be asked - just don't fall for those conspiracy theories.
“World War III is looming.” Since he has no vision, or policy, or record to run on, Trump tries new campaign tactic: he’s going to try and scare the hell out of you. He reeks of desperation, and it’s just plain pathetic. https://t.co/CY659gYWRv
Fair point
Rep. Reschenthaler doesn’t seem to agree that things are going badly at the moment. 
Really??  What have they done to deliver a strong economy??  Pardon the French - they have not done sh__, but offer a tax plan to make the rich rich and land an even greater tax burden on the middle class than it already has.
The only thing that scares the hell out of me is Trump being President again.
Trumpski
He'll probably be safe enough in jail.
Thats ALL they do , is fearmonger....and tell you a recession is coming in two weeks.....for a year
Still a loser.
At the same time:
Greene and Cruz et al doing the same. Vocal minority is doing what Hitler did in the early 30s to take over the entire country. Sounds very familiar to what we hear today on alt right media, government etc.
Brought to you by the traitor who tried to overthrow his own government while he was president. The level of privilege this guy has still walking around free, whew.
His fear mongering was started around the border!  Fear mongering is his forte.
It's all they got!
There was a time not long ago that disgraceful rhetoric from a former POTUS would be condemned by BOTH sides of the aisle. Since apparently we only have ONE party committed to the Constitution, it is up to us to condemn this scoundrel's comments LOUDLY &amp; FREQUENTLY. Pass it on.
He is right about leadership being solely responsible.. His "leadership" as a one term failure unearthed every racist in our country
Why do his answers always say “like never before”?
I'm more concerned about having healthy non-expired drinking water without chemicals. That is a bigger threat than WWW III.
 The pondered the idea whether Trump was a Manchurian Candidate, but were they aware of a Celebrity Therapist fmr. Beauty Queen who had access and skills to mfr. a Manchurian Candidate. I cited her to the Fed Gov in a 2013 Fraud case for manipulating patients behavior
He always uses "like never before"
He did this before.  People got wise to his game.
Agent Orange is "shouting 'FIRE!' in a crowded theater" from down inside his Mar-A-Lago bunker!
The campaign tactics are the same.   Fear was used in 2016 as well (Mexicans are rapists, Drugs, Muslim ban, …etc)    what’s different is the object:  “WWIII is looming’ - that is being used to stoke fear.
Sir…I believe you’re already there.
In the history of history of history…
Indictments are looming on Trump's horizon.
 will be there soon have a seat
“Reeks” and Trump are the ultimate word pairing
This isn’t a new tactic.  Don’t forget Trump tried to win the suburban vote in 2020 by warning about [black] people coming for low-income housing in their neighborhoods.  And that was after he won the Republican nomination in 2016 by scapegoating Mexicans and Muslims.
Still on the “only I can fix it” grift…
It is his only way to wiggle out of his legal woes. Get elected again and Putin also has his path to victory. The U.S. Putin army (Carlson, Gabbard, Gosar, Gaetz, MTG) are already working feverishly to make it so.  GOP, the party of doom and gloom.
He’s always been trying to scare everyone. Gloom and doom right from the start
Sounds like he’s asking people to fight for him again,to destroy their own country to keep him from prison but ask yourself why would you do that to your country for one selfish man? We may not like or agree with other people’s ways hate is not the answer it’s not god’s way
Trump: "World War III is looming, its the biggest most beautiful Loom in the history of our country. The Looming gets the highest ratings of any Loom ever. Its a perfect Loom"
Gangrene a close second…
Fear and hate. It’s the tRump two-pronged campaign trademark.
Someone sounds upset that Ivanka will be testifying to the grand jury, instead of giving him lap dances, so he's  riling up his base.
Trump worst President ever
He tried to start it. Maybe he doesn’t get to complain about it. Or is he boasting about it?
It’s like not blaming Hitler for WW2. He can’t and won’t point a finger at the aggressor, at Putin.
He’s pathetic.
FN criminal Trump needs to be locked up already!
You don't think fighting Russia has the slightest possibility to become ww3?
yes is the sound of a deperate man
White Fear has been his thing from the get. Remember the brown hordes coming across the border?
Someone needs to tell him it is not His Country you are a “Citizen of this Country it’s just sad you don’t behave like one and neither are your followers
#NAME?
Pathetic is his middle name.  I extend that to anybody who enables him.
Exactly and we have not even come close to the tactics he is willing to stoop to regain power and avoid or at least evade prosecution.
Anyone who loves our country and works in government or has an influence on policy needs to ensure that this man is shut up and kept away from public office and social media.
May I never meet the person who says, “Oh man! WW3 is coming. I better vote for Trump to stop it.”
“New” campaign tactic? There’s nothing new about Republicans using fear to get votes. In fact, when have they EVER used policy or record to run on?
Says the wannabe dictator that tried to drag us into a civil war the traitor doesn’t know what leadership means
He is a fearmonger, All GOP is. But that's ALL he ever used when he was in the White House,
It's no tactic, it's pure &amp; simple jealousy that in 1 week was able to inspire the World &amp; heightened the US standing in the World more than #TFG abased it in 4 years!
“like never before” is just one of the tells that let you know he’s lying, just in case you were wondering. 
Always negative. Always about himself. It’s getting old.
World War 3 has been looming since the 70s
Someone seems a little nervous right now.
He is a sad little boy
PATHETIC!!!!
In fairness scaring everyone has always been all he’s had. This is just a new subject.
He is grasping at straws
And he doesn’t care if he destroys the country to get what he wants…
We should remember how TFG handled a virus (covid) &amp; that should tell us how he would handle any other major event.
Grumpy is becoming insignificant! Deathsantis is also not playing well outside of increasingly red florida- the state where people move 1/2 a year plus one day, to avoid paying taxes! Bring on somebody new!
Everything with him is 'like never before'.   There were a lot of never befores in his administration and beyond. Were any of the 'this is the first time' not immoral, unethical and/or illegal?
of course there would be no chance of WWIII under Trump because he would give everything away for a bag of cash under the table.
He has a long history of being Mr Fear
If he hadn't coddled Putin, we'd have a lot less to worry about.
I believe that he's stupid enough to think bluster is leadership.
Trump emboldened Putin by caving to all of Putin's demands while Trump was President and by convincing Putin the US would not do anything if Putin invaded Ukraine. This entire scenario is on Putin and Trump, not Biden. Trump's animosity toward China may cause China to join Russia
So dark and dangerous. Pathetic indeed.
Hopefully Americans know better.
Actually, the "most dangerous time in the history of our country" was when he was in the White House...
His only regret is that can’t be in the middle of it and profit from it.
Please stop sharing his words. That just feeds into his ego.
Barron checked the cybers for him, so now he is a futurist
Does Donnie want fries and ketchup with his doom and gloom boom or not?
They did that in 2016 too. Russia said if Hillary won she would start WWIII. Trump immediately parroted it.
That's not a new tactic.
Trump would be a DISASTER acting as a WARTIME POTUS! Can you imagine? Remember how he mishandled the Pandemic, asylum seekers at the border, his " Generals", his inability to read briefings, colluding, obstructing to abusing the power of his office,  losing an election?
He’s not wrong you corrupt little presstitute.
When the chief purveyor of oblivion inadvertently &amp; absentmindedly warns you about himself, it’s just another day in Trumplandia.
Agreed
But you have to call out his lies.   Under trump, WWIII would be looming even moreso because he would have given away Ukraine and looked the other way when Putin went after Poland, Estonia, Moldova and everything else. Trump is Putin's best ally.
World War lll is looming. There’s a case to be made that we’re already in it.
I wish he would get The Flag of the United States of America off his face 
"in the very dark and murky background"
They need a new way to get people to send money.
And trumpski will never get my vote, ever.
It's so disturbing he still holds such sway over members of our society. No wonder people seem to have lost all sanity and reason.
It's dangerous because he can't sell out USA to Putin.
Fear has only ever been his thing
This has been Fox's tactic for decades. If you have listened to any right wing radio for the last 30 years, it's the same.
Biggest liar in America only spreads hatred and violence and conspiracy theories
Really! That fact that Mr. Koch is not supporting Trump for president 2024. And doesn't Mr.Koch own the republican party?
Why doesn’t he shut up!? He is your typical bully using fear to intimidate.
Go golfing.
Politicians fear monger all the time on both sides of the aisle. Get off your high horse and chill.
Now this is a story that should be made into a movie! No nonsense woman, u like the grandson
Every investigation that is happening right now is one person's fault.   The crooked man who tries to cheat his way in everything he does.   A true LOSER. If he was a winner, he would not have to lie to make himself look good. He would win by merits.
I hope to God the Fulton County special jury finally announces their recommendations this week!!
President Biden gets far more respect from world leaders than ol' poopy pants ever did.
Love it - tRump reeks of desperation- so true.
Someone needs to put trump AND his ilk in their place fast.
#Democrats need to be more proactive in exposing #Republican ‘s lies and at the same time, they need to #market their accomplishments over and over, day and night.
A good reason to keep him off Twitter. Maybe not re-tweet everything?
He’s truly a pathetic baby.
If he was in charge he’d be making googly eyes at Putin
Nothing like a cheerful start for the nation.
Because he said it, I have no fear of WWlll.
Yes he is
I hate when he uses the phrase “like never before”.
Lol, 
Oh the sky is falling….
Meanwhile.... Merrick Garland be like......
The sky is falling…so says Trump running from the wheels of justice 
The only time I was worried was when Trump was in charge.
Yeah, Mike, but ohh did he hand out 10 years out of date bottled water with teh Trump label on it, to those people in E Palestine? Wooh, what about that!  And, he gave them a few palettes of Goya canned beans!  its just making me all . .  misty.
He is one of the most evil people to ever walk the planet.
He's scared!
Fear mongering has always been in his  playbook.
He seems to forget that he helped push the world on this path by trying to pressure Ukraine to bend to Putin’s will…instead of helping them when they were turning the tide against the Russian’s occupying Donbas.
Actually, he's not wrong. If you look in the bible, Russia and China ultimately get together and go against Israel. So the idea of Russia and China tag teaming is not so out there as you might think. Just another prophecy being fulfilled before our eyes. 
When45 was inaugurated I played ‘two minutes to midnight”   He is the end times
Return to sender .... Fixed it for him.
Humpty Trumpty had already prepared his Superman costume!  What happened to the 200 lbs of fat?
Trump is being modest. The darkest day in our history 1/06/2021, and he wins the honor for making it so. Thanks to his abuse of the highest office in our land, he inspired and incited an unlawful coup against the nation he took an oath to defend. Trump is best at being worst.
When was demagoguery a new tactic, for any Trump?  Fear was always his stock in trade.  It's a formula:  Terrorize your followers, scapegoat, incite rage, smear your opponents for supporting the scapegoat, and promise to save everybody.  That's what a Trump rally is, every time.
Such a LOSER CRYBABY
unfortunately, selling fear is trump's most successful enterprise
Putin really did get his money’s worth
Every MAGA is saying the same exact thing online right now.   They are all pathetic.
You know I genuinely think he believes this. He spent four years kowtowing to the worlds despots, which is bad for world stability long term, but bought him a fake sense of a world at peace.   China, Russia, North Korea, and the Middle East leaders love his foreign policy.
would've let Russia just take over Ukraine. Thank God for
Go away!
Oooh … so THIS is where are all of that “war mongering” is coming from!!!
Trump
He loves to say, “like never before”.
I will bet ww III does not happen
Meet the new campaign.  Same as the old campaign.
trump willing to subjugate to a weak mob ruler who can’t defeat an invaded country. As the most advanced nation in the world, you have to ask yourself why?
He's sending messages to Xi and Putin telling them to start one.
Sice you were president the country has slowly been going down hill with your division of our people!
WWIII isn't looming, criminal indictments are. #IndictTraitorTrump
I was so sure he's referred to world war iii previously, "as never before," that I wasn't going to even bother to check.  Oh, what the hell.  It didn't take long.  He can dodge that war, too.
I'm no longer willing to read Trump's tweets.
I don't pay any attention to that cunned stunt.
Blah blah blah.
Wait until the indictments.
DOJ, what are you going to do with this guy. Unprecedented
IMO. He’s signaling Putin.
It occurs to me that Republicans are using Russian army tactics, desperately flinging themselves into the fray, only to be mowed down by facts, science, politics or common sense.  We’re seeing a lot of that lately.
soon he will be blaming mexicans for ww3.
This has shades of his doom and gloom inauguration speech 
"Like never before." Why does have to refer to everything in the superlative?
trump is a Loser!
I really wish he would stop with the fear mongering.  Everyone is just exhausted from GOP fear mongering and lies.
Like WWII, Joe Biden is leading us to VICTORY! Freedom and Democracy Will Not Be Defeated!
If there is a World War 3 one thing's for damn sure their won't be anyone last name Trump fighting for America
And trump brought us here.
So says the cowardly Draft dodger!!! 
Most dangerous time was the Trump presidency.
Someone like Trump who trusts Putin over our intelligent agencies should never be President again
Doom and Gloom… that’s their platform.
He’s never uttered a positive message
He and his fellow GOPers always try to scare people. It fires up their base. Fear is a great motivator.
Consider the source… yawn …..
&amp; i wouldn't even now about it if You hadn't retweeted him!
He would have us kowtow to Putin much like Chamberlain kowtowed to Hitler announcing 'peace for our time" in 1938 and announcing war with Germany in 1939
the most dangerous time in our country was wehen he took office
HOPELESS  tRump.
You do realize that Biden himself talked about the possibility of “Armageddon” at a fundraising event last October?
That has been the republican party since 1980. Scare tactics
And his cult will believe him! Pitiful!!
Thank goodness Trump is not our president
Said the two time draft dodging Florida retiree.
Well then let’s just party like it’s 1939.
4 and 5-syllable words? Well, what do you know!
It’s The sky is falling technique.
By pretending he’s a balloon from China?
How would You respond to Ted Cruz ??
U.S. recovers electronic sensors from Chinese balloon; Japan says China entered its airspace 3 times https://t.co/Gve3jGltRX via
How did China get the dead zones of our radar systems? If they used one to float a suitcase nuke over America say around Yellowstone and detonated it, that would just about do it for America once those two Magma bulbs blow. I am sure our enemies would never take advantage of that
All we've heard the last few days from American media and government is "China will supply lethal weapons to Russia", the fear was instilled in the public and now the President clears the air and tells everyone what's really happening:  https://t.co/WaftBsxsVk
I wonder if an average American considers which is worst, spending so much time and resources on foreign policies to protect freedom, or allowing their domestic affairs regress to the point when basic necessities cannot be met to support freedom.
What a brilliant question Kang! I’m going to use this tweet in my livestream this evening!
Agree Cyrus its a gem! : )
Most people elsewhere can see through his charade.
I have a feeling this will become a self fulfilling prophecy. They will just show evidence of the quality of Iraq had wmd’s and the people will fall for it for the nth time. They will act on them, and then, well, this is basically a direct threat of “you are next” so…
Antony Blinken is far too hawkish.
U.S. politics now is a hot mess.
I hope they meet and have a conversation.
US diplomats stir up trouble and then the President elect (means any president on borrowed time) has to correct it. Talks about not being on the same page. What's going on here?
They wanted to take the wind out the Chinese peace plan
didn't stop them applying more completely unnecessary sanctions to Chinese companies. tit for tat China should blacklist some US companies now.
USA politicians are not trustable.
clearly the US politicians just like to lie.
Meanwhile, American M1 Abrams tanks, American Javelin anti-tank missiles, American M777 howitzers, American Bradleys, and American HIMARS weapons are being supplied to Ukraine
“US supplies lethal weapons to Taiwan?” 
Yeah sure, I don’t think we have 31.6 trillion dollars in debt 
Even Ii the Chinese are, it's completely legit as well.
A lie is halfway 'round the world before the  truth has got its boots on.
You had me when you said Biden clears the air. The guy can't even navigate a flight of stairs.
Why doesn't the USA government focus on it's own house, which is apparently on fire and under water at the same time?
I would argue Chinese arms sales to Russia are inevitable as a consequence of fact that the West is trying to force a defeat on Russia that will create immense pressure on China.   No one believes this diplomacy stuff now, and the West has been hostile to diplomacy all along
Muddying the water: this is a dance between the establishment and deep state and their media mouthpieces. Nothing more. I will continue to ignore all of them and form my own opinion about the motives of American military state.
North Americans... 
Blinken heard that wrong. China was considering providing legal assistance and not lethal assistance to Russia in the wake of the banditry West’s threat to seize Russian foreign reserves frozen by the West
The viewership-driven MSM must reform or they would die like dinosaurs in the face of OpenAI and open source news. I recently signed up to only get my news from 1440. anyone knew about them?
It is sad/bad that Americans are so easily manipulated! News?!  Even the BBC spreading anti-China. Ads in LA area for Shen Yun say it is the wonderful culture of China before communism! China has said they will not provide weapons to Russia. Let's see what happens. GROG
China is neutral most of the time.
All western media are pushing the bi- dictatorship's (Republican and Democrat) propaganda. The fact is US of Atrocities is likely to start WW3.
Love it when Joe goes 'off-script' and does his own thing! #PeaceNotWar
They just keep on pushing these Sinophobic psyops. It's always the same thing; float some boogey man story about China, doesn't matter if any of it is true. the damage is done.
The US has been sending weapons to Taiwan. Not only weapons but military personnel as well. So?
Biden has decided to defeat nuclear war capable Russia and China, who are now strong allies, and he wants to defeat them simultaneously. That’s best evidence for impeachment based on wrongheaded incompetence putting our nation at risk of destruction.
Sounds more like political muddying of the water so that the biggest military powers of the world can further accelerate the obscene arms race they have created &amp; imposed on the rest of us poor buggers! 
#Washington's orchestration of #Russia's "unprovoked" invasion of #Ukraine is going so well that they are busily planning #China's "unprovoked" invasion of its own province of #Taiwan. U.S. troops and weapons are going in. Never mind 50 years of the U.S. 'One China' policy.
The gun-paranoid warmongering Anglo-American species - the only criminals never brought to justice for committing a myriad of heinous crimes against humanity...their racketeering administrations /corporations have used money/deceits to justify their crimes from time immemorial.
These people never quit.  They ought to STFU at this point.
Says the country who just sent spy balloons and lied about it. I would advise against believing anything from China’s tyrannical leadership.
You know it’s bad when u got China’s leader calling for peace
Imagine someone being so dim-witted that they think a $12 balloon had spy equipment, a navigation system, a motor, flew at 60,000 feet, and propelled itself from China.  It looks like an asinine deflection from his treason. https://t.co/JeoYUs5Lmu
So a spy plane, in the South China Sea to spy on Chinese activities in their region with a propaganda team from CNN on board?  Thank goodness its not a Balloon, or they'd have to shoot it down to match the US precedent set over the past month.
It's not illegal to reclaim land from the sea to develop low lying islands or reefs.   Vietnam and Malaysia have done it in the SCS too.   Sit down war propagandist. The State department has you shilling for every war the US starts.   READ A BOOK
"20 othet countries (including Brazil, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam) insist that military activities such as close-in surveillance by a country in another country’s EEZ infringe on coastal states’ security interests and therefore are not protected under freedom of navigation."
You know South China Sea doesn’t belong to China right?
What right does that give the US military to surveil Chinese territory IN the South China Sea?
Found the fool.   Learn what “international waters” are.
US aircraft intercept Russian aircraft over "International waters" all the time.   Or is what you're saying that "some animals are more equal than others"?... Fool.  The Russians and Chinese just don't have propaganda teams from the MSM on board to feed idiots like you
Looky a dummy trying to change the subject!!  All capable nations do this.   You asked a specific question.   Don’t cry when the answer reveals your ignorance.
You'll find that - as usual - it's the US military complaining of "unprofessional intercepts" of their spy planes to generate media buzz. With actual media teams on board to amplify their message.  Since when are intercepts of surveilance jets and bombers controversial?
He’s from fucking BOTSwana hahaha irrelevant
It wasn’t dumb to shoot down balloons. It was a case of fuck around and find out. If the Americans send balloons over China then they can shoot them down and show the world. Until then, we only have evidence of this behaviour from China.
Apparently I see know future deliveries from China balloons no parts for the school buses, for the near future.
The VP of the United States is excited about the idea of USB ports in a vehicle, something that has existed for nearly 20 years.
Despite launching 464 Long March rockets with satellites, the US was frightened by one out of course weather balloon from China. They forget China has also launched a Moon and Mars landers/rovers. China's space station is doing well. Congratulations to the Chinese space program.
#China successfully sent a new remote sensing satellite into spacea with a Long March-2C carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China this afternoon.  The launch was the 464th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.
And it's obvious he's got the help of #Russia &amp; #China with their #balloons &amp; #UFOs, to do it! Pathetique! Stay away from our #Volcanos with your #NuclearBombs! #JackSmith Please arrest #Trump FIRST so all of this nonsense will stop! 🇺🇸🇨🇦 https://t.co/5U0hvG55Hj
China’s Spymasters Can Get More From TikTok Than From Balloons  https://t.co/3kjgsfKH4r https://t.co/ujWygTqIFQ
One of what is certainly a long list of Trojan Horses that are riding along in our pockets.
sorta like the domestic spying of FBI, DHS, NSA ?
Human intel, but comms and surveillance…
Big G knows more about us than we do!
Everybody’s just putting on an act. So we’re now all going into World War III with absurd caricatures of everything.
the data is a problem, the algorithm, a bigger problem.  But how do we advocate a ban on tiktoc with t/BS going on with big tech/social media in our own country?  as much I want to, I can't endorse that play.
NO, USA have atrocious human rights record, PRC have lifted 800M citizens out of poverty, you can buzz off with your fake activism. https://t.co/Bi7SP7j6Z6
I met many Tibets in Nepal while living there &amp; NONE of them were happy about China occupying their country and NONE celebrated it!
Tibetans in Nepal were the former ruling elites who oppressed Tibetan serfs, ofc they are angry that they lost their power. But ordinary Tibetans in China are enjoying their liberation from serfdom, so stop trying to disrupt their lives.
Stop trying to sanitize the brutal overthrow of Tibet by the Chinese.  Some of those living there now MAY want it to stay as it is.  But China did not then nor now give them a choice.  Don't rewrite what happened.  ANd China has a VERY sh1tty record on human rights.
The "spy balloons" are not from China, they are from the media. Those news media manufacture fake news about "China Bad" every day and night.
They want war. War is the way those "elite politicians" survive.
How China's approach to spying differs from Russia's https://t.co/1fxt5DY734 via #TikTok #China
"revelations about TikTok’s data being accessible from China raise a serious possibility that some of that information could be accessed by the Chinese government. The app has a growing role in politics, and is essentially designed to build profiles of users’ interests " #China
WARNING: Very disturbing and shocking. Large numbers of children’s bodies were found in an underground facility in China soaked in formalin.  Two million people go missing every year in China.   Is this related to Organ Harvesting? https://t.co/Ud471TJFUT
Nothing to see here, need i remind you “Trump Bad!”
Misspelled biden.
So Horrific, Wee Soul’s 
Just like Ukraine. Organ harvesting.
God please come quickly!
God is always present.
You are right.♡
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
Come Lord Jesus Come 
With the way the world is going. This is all I've got to add.
exactly
What we have been saying all along, but we were crazy conspiracy theorists.
Feb 24 Audacy The Tore Says Show addresses the issue
 very disturbing. Satanic. The Cabal?!
#Nuland wants to give #XiJinping a Nobel Prize
HUGE business in organ harvesting especially children. ABHORRENT 
Eric Swallowwell's friends did this.
God help us all
Are the majority of the children’s bodies female?  The ideal in China is a male child, correct?  After that is achieved they want to limit reproduction. I know they supposedly ended their one child policy in 2015, and allowed two. How can you believe anything China says?
China and N korea are the 2 most evil places in the world.When their tyrant leaders want to be worshipped over God so much all relgion is banned, satan takes over and this is the result. The dead ones are lucky, the ones they sell into slavery are forgotten death would be a mercy
Mon dieu aide nous à libérer tous les enfants. Ces images sont terribles
This is truly bloody awful and brutal. This is one of the most disturbing things I have seen. I really feel sick seeing this. Omg what is going on? This has to stop. Anyone with info please come forward in Gods name. This is absolutely vile and sick. I wish my eyes hasn't seen 
I cannot even place a like on this article. I feel so much for those poor children.
Please somebody tell me this isn't real. Some kind of sick joke.
Unfortunately it's probably not fake...
Hoping this is just a scene from a movie I haven’t seen.
Shocking!!!
 I guess we have to see it but some evils are too bad for words and such pictures are unforgettable.
F China!!!
Not just China. This is a wWorld Wide problem. Many tunnels under the U.S also. You are gonna find out soon that many big named before were involved in child trafficking and pedophilia. Hell is too good for them!!!!
Like a scene from hell!
Adrenochrome harvesting
They will stand before God very soon for this
Well now that just effd...
Viendo quien lo publica,desacredita la publicacion desde ya a pesar de ser horroroso ya tiene un sesgo geopolitico.
 Thank you Jesus for protecting the children all around the world, they are the sweetest Angels. Thank you God for Divine Protection from all evil towards our children!! Oh God, we are so ready for Your return, so you can lay down these beasts!! In  Jesus Name Amen!
Don’t give the woke politicians any ideas.
Uigers ?
Look at Ukraine first.
This is what socialism leads to. All the greatest atrocities over the last 105 years have all occurred in socialist countries. They dehumanize people to normalize further and further taxation until the point that people are used for nothing more than their origins.
Organ harvesting, adrenochrome, dispensables, falun gong
Next time at least pick someone speak Chinese plz. Or try to found someone looks like Chinese. Or do some reading to find out how formalin work.
Vile! 
What now？
I wonder if those were all little girls?
Of course intimidation is everywhere and I can't fall for it but I feel sorry for the Fallen ones。
My all children Souls rest in peace。
God help these children 
This is horrible,we need to stop this immediately!!!
If you support China your a trader.
Over in America it's called Planned Parenthood.
Because the west also purchases said organs
And this is exactly what fox news reported about with the cartels selling kids and for sex and body parts,  Biden has helped the cartels become even more aggressive and profitable,   sickening
Does anyone know what the video of the little girl in red is about?
that looks like after the organ harvesting
What the actual f did I just watch
Sickening
the first part is really creepy! why U even heard a child talking. In the second part of the video, they don’t even speak chinese, they don’t look chinese to me too.
Omg these poor babies!!!  Jesus please comfort and heal them
so disgusting. Cannot even imagine these children’s fear
People will have to see this evil to believe.  But like all government Catch-22 it is illegal to show pictures of children suffering.   The proof is their only not.
These people are not Chinese. They aren’t speaking Chinese either.
OMG!!!!!
Oh lord that is awful
Same in Ukraine
I cant wait to see this in action! 
Starting to think Squid Games was a documentary.
Does anyone know if the 200 or so school girls that were kidnapped from Oprah's school I think in Africa were ever found?
This is sooo sick and disturbing. Jesus. Omg. How can anyone? 
Execution for organ harvesters
What the actual F?????!? If this is real, it's beyond comprehension. My god.
God have mercy!
Don’t know what this is but it fucked up
When I was just a little kid at six or seven years old, and saw President Nixon talking with Mao, Mao gave me the creeps, just looking at him. There was something about him, even though I didn’t know the politics of China. I thought we never should’ve done business with them.
This is so sick
Adrenachrome
Seeing it is incomprehensible. It's unimaginable until you know the truth.
I'm sure that's exactly  what's going on.
It looks as if their bodies were crushed, and rib cages broken- bodies mutilated, before being what looks like, being disposed of in this type of acid.
This is by far the most sinister thing I have ever seen.  I am shocked… 
Organ harvesting is probably the most likely cause but in a World of Universal Deceit it is hard to truly know.
Disgusted. #GodFirst #PrayForTheWorld
I'm sick to my stomach if this is true. Utterly the most evil thing
This is what will happen in the 15 minute cities.
So sickening how this evil continues to prevail.
God we need you! Help us. 
US gets the same business done in UKRAIN.
It looks like one of those Adrene-ochrome factories…I wonder if that is. where joe gets his supply? 
Oh dear God! Please make this stop!
Una mierda de seres humanos y todos cierran los ojos, es abominable, satánico, vomitivo. Esta sociedad está enferma y ninguna autoridad mundial hace algo y se pregunta el porqué, x que son cómplices. Justicia Divina para todos estos niños arrebatados, Amen!!
I don’t know what the story is. And to be honest, I don’t need to know. What we need to do, as human beings of every colour, religion or political ideology, is come together to hunt down the ones responsible and bring them to Justice. For ever and ever. Amen.
China es el Laboratorio Social del Gobierno Mundial que quieren imponernos.
those poor babies ..I'm bawling ..I get back flashes from video of killary and ohms I didn't sleep for a month I begged and prayed for God to take those visions away.. I still get once in awhile but nothing like 5 years qgo
This is going on in Ukraine as well! And we are helping it!
There are honestly some days that you wish you didn’t have eyeballs.   Or a heart.
Why even share this. Energy drain
It's world wide :(
God bless you halp 
all for your god lucifer and for phantom matrix. pure filth.
Gotta love it
China is a spooky ass place.
 what an evil world.  God knows.
Horrible  sauvons tous les enfants du monde 
Wtf??
Adrene ochome
Horrible
Makes you so sick that anyone could do these horrific things … anytime God we have enough proof anytime !!
Adrenochrome
With 10% for the Big Guy.
I tried to find provenance for this video, but all I got was a couple of tweets and a banned YouTube.
Holy 
China
Who found them?
OMG! 
2 million????
This is awful if true.
That has to smell like hell, very sad and disturbing
Who has the power to stop that ?
Many Countries the same
Debemos acabar con la élite mafiosa y macabra. Pedofilia, adenochomo y tráfico de órganos, es el negocio más lucrativo, junto con las farmacéuticas y el tráfico de narcóticos. No estaremos a salvó mientras las grandes familias, sigan dominando al mundo.
So much evil in this old world.
A baby liver on the black market is worth around $40,000. All the organs in the body if sold our worth around $500,000. I don’t think the average person, especially in the west, has a clue how much of this goes on in the world.
Dear little loves, I’m so sorry you had to bare these evil atrocities and experience first hand the darkest hell on earth. May you be at peace now, held in the warmest embrace of love, surrounded by the safest light. May your little hearts be free now of all fear, pain, &amp; worry.
Humanity at its finest
These people are 
This is absolutely horrendous. I don’t even have words. This type of evil was unimaginable to me. It’s beyond the kind of evil I ever imagined to exist.
Androchromium
China, Biden, Zelensky, WEF, WHO... OMG.
reminds me of
The one newspaper that has been documenting organ harvesting for years is The Epoch Times.
Is that the saddest, sickest thing you’ve seen in forever?   “If he were thrown into the sea with a huge rock tied to his neck, he would be far better off than facing the punishment in store for those who harm these little children’s souls. I am warning you!“ Lk 17:2
What the FUCK did I just watch
Hell on earth wow this is the worst thing I have ever seen in my entire life. God bless us all we’re going to need it after what these people have done
Those who know can’t sleep! 
#China es la peor plaga del mundo
Very disturbing.
Its not just coal the burn for power...
This dirty business between by the American capital  money and Chinese operations for the favour of the global satanic elites as exclusive customers for the human genuine parts and cosmetics products from human body by the way all Hollywood celebrity is a regular customers 
Is this recent video? Seen one few years back.
Could b. Certainly.
Where is this at?
A first world country they say
Harvesting shmarvesting
Seems fake to me. How can China release such videos. China censors everything and without approval they don't release anything. Such videos will never be released at all.
this needs to be investigated
This is beyond horrific and heartbreaking
Dónde se filmó? Cuándo? Quién lo filmó? Cómo logró llegar ahi? Nadie denuncia estos hechos? Falta mucha data.
Hay que acabar con ellos. Que paguen el sufrimiento de esos pobres niños
Gird yourself in Gods word and pray one day we get to hold those responsible for this evil travesty accountable
VIDEOS FROM A FEW YRS AGO ARE FINALY GETTING OUT
there is no limit to the wickedness of those without God.
These people that do this must all be put in the ground fast for mankind’s sake
What did you doubters want? A Hollywood glitzy version? This is obviously footage that was very dangerous for the people to film and export. Yes, a child was probably with them when they discovered the place, and someone crudely edited it. But that makes it very real to me.
Q was a psyop.
One thing for certain I would not make a good *Camera Person* !! There would not be a one *Harvester* leaving that building alive and the rest would be hunted!
Those poor babies Omgroceries those poor babies God have mercy
If you're running a huge child organ harvesting operation...why would you leave the bodies and remains around like this...without cremating the rest of the remains and spreading the ashes.
If there is a Seller there is a Buyer  Take Care  Only for the few that want to look into that horrors
Bij ons het sterftecijfer ongeveer 9000/maand In China sterven maandelijks 60.000 mensen.Ze hebben dan ook 1,5 MILJARD inwoners.Dus kan het wel zijn dat stervende hun organen geoogst worden. Dit beeld is schokkend  maar  dat wil nog niet zeggen dat ze vermoord werden.
So would every other democrat
Is this the mausoleum for the Biden and Clinton pedo crime family's victims?
Could be remaining from the Communist revolution that Democrats are so happy about.
Sorry just really makes me mad! There is a special place in hell!
OMG !  Hell is awaiting these freaking  ghouls.
这是中国？你开玩笑呢？这不是中国话，也不是中国人，更不是中国。
这都不是中国话，人也不是中国人。fake  news
When a country, which is the tool of the global gang called USA, starts demonizing another country, it means that it will declare war on that country. USA, we know you well, Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, where will you attack now?
This is the result of socialism where not every individual is valued and has rights!
We need to help Chinese people like we helped Syrian already I guess...
Likely fake. Be careful before spreading this stuff around
CCP is a depraved government and the fact Biden is handing over control of our health safety and response to UN an organization complicit in these atrocities in China is a formula for hundreds of millions of deaths under communist ideology.  Bidens WHI treaty is treasonous.
The Chinese govt is made up of the most evil people in the world. Unfortunately our current Dem President &amp; administration turns a blind eye to this evil Country because they are bought &amp; paid for. Trump was the only President to stand up to this evil &amp; the Dems hated him for it.
Maybe it’s the tunnels in DC; not China?? even if it’s narrated in Chinese- don’t discount anything anymore  we know how the blood thirsty left is
Yeonmi Park, who escaped from North Korea, was recently on the Megyn Kelly show and talked of the horrors of child trafficking in China for sex or organs.
did this !
This is what Biden and Deep State are funding!  Democrats are pure evil.
China’s Spymasters Can Get More From TikTok Than From Balloons - good read https://t.co/CbIoIsxHgK
So now that all the ranting from the US/U.K. media about spy balloons from China has suddenly disappeared after they shit a few down, has any evidence been produced to support the claims? Or are they quietly forgetting about it.
And yet the biggest National Security threat is still walking free. Trump probably sold most of the secrets by now. China probably I’m sure had locations for spy balloons from Trump. Putin’s invasion courtesy of Top Secret Documents from Trump.
This makes top-secret docs easier to sell!
The Pentagon tracked the balloon since it took off from China so. That's on Biden And General buttercup. Plus the fact the balloon was filled w 3 bus loads worth of explosives and joey Brandon and the Pentagon just let it fly all over the USA. That's all on them
China. No investigation from their CCP, but has enough clout to send spy balloons to the US. Oh, and steal US military technology. 🤔
How China's approach to spying differs from Russia's https://t.co/Opb6Sfyqyj via
Is the NSA still spying on its allies?
One is a thief the other is a criminal?
Russia probably tries very hard and China is like "We just got them to install TikTok because they are dumb lolz."
Follow for news on spying and terrorism.  We tweet daily.  #PeopleWatching
Do we not have the strategic defense capabilities to have been able to apprehend the Chinese balloon usings means other than shooting it down? It doesn't make sense. I understand China claimed the balloon, but I don't trust most government officials from any state. NWO is here.
During the Trump administration several spy balloons from China flew over are country and nobody knew about it because Trump kept it quiet. Because Trump's daughter was in negotiations to get contracts for the Trump company
Joe Biden said the Chinese spy balloon was “not relevant once it was over the United States.”  The spy balloon traveled across the country, spying on Americans. What is he talking about?
Can you explain how I am able to receive 5-10 fake #Medicare telemarketing calls per week from China. It breaks 4-5 different laws. A lot of orgs are involved, with Democrats &amp; AT&amp;T Wireless at the top.   This is a lot like the Chinese spy balloons! Whatever it takes, right!
Same balloon Cruz said should be shot down because it was from China.  Funny how he changed his story all of a sudden.
I’m old enough to remember that last weekend we were still talking about aliens invading us. And spy balloons from China.

Typical response! The potentially impeached former Gov couldn’t tell a China spy balloon from the Wizard’s balloon leaving Oz. Wizard tried to run Oz but he lied to Ozians. Cuomo mocks Biden 4 ‘badly handled' China spy balloon by of NYPost https://t.co/z8hOtYLX6I
Just grasping at anything on his way down
Bitter, Party of 1
Someone want to remind Cuomo how he 'badly handled' the breasts and buttocks of female employees
Let me guess. He’s going to try to revive his political career by going MAGA. 
Nursing home slaughter…just as planned! He handled mass murder well 
The Cuomo brothers have ruined their future and what ever legacy they had. Really sad. I always liked Chris on CNN.
Don’t you love these discredited folks finding their voice and worse become experts on Cable News. Plenty of proof.  Experts on TV when their failed policies got us into failed wars.
No one cares about Cuomo... failure.
Why did  run to a tiny C-Tier network? No one wants to hear him any more.... Take the cue.
And *this* guy knows PR! ROFL.
Cuomo was always a DINO, the reason Albany was stuck for so long, even with a Democratic majority in the state. This comes as no surprise.
Attempting to be relevant.
He’s the last person who should be mocking someone.
Disgraced former governor, best keep quiet.
Coumo  brothers need the keep hands to themselves.
Como, the disgraced ex-governor,  throwing stones to sooth his failures!
It's so funny to watch Andrew Cuomo flail when he has no power and no one's afraid of him.
You lost me at "Cuomo"
He’s just mad because he wasn’t able to sexually harass it
just embarrassing  they try to white wash their actions
Cuomo is trash.
You are no longer relevant Mario. Ciao
I liked Andrew. No more. He’s gone to the dark side.
Does anyone care what is the disgraced fallen Governor’s opinion about a National Security matter like this? If yes, why?
Then, he is criticizing our military. They were the ones to advise President Biden.  This blaming the person at the top has to stop. In any large organization, if it is run well,that person takes input from the leaders under him or her, rather than making decisions on their own.
Andrew is undoubtedly desperate to get back in the game, a sentiment not shared by any number of people, evidently including some sensible people in the Biden administration.
Andrew who?
Typical....priceless
The cuomos are desgraces. NYP, redicuous, no reputable media outlet would give either is these perverted grifters the time of day.
Shut up Cuomo
A. Cuomo left politics in disgrace.  He should mind his manners and keep his mouth shut.
surprised he found the time between sexually harassing people out committing some form of corruption he's known for
You mean Former disgraced Andrew Cuomo has come out to see if he still casts a shadow?
Yeah, I guess all these critics no more than the our defense department. Who do you think keeps our nation safe but you guys all want all our secrets we got it out of the balloon to be told on TV ! so you can start a war war three with China. Lose lips sink ships!
democrats not so smart to let Cumo risgin
Cuomo should have been locked up and threw the key away. He is an idiot mocking our president
Disgraced P. O. 
If the dude was President he'd probably invite the Balloon over for drinks and try to it!!  What an idiot.
Americans still get negro money by planting fake cases and using them for prison labor, and Americans make more money from negro music than negroes do, but China money from Africa is more legit.  Now, China has balloons flying over American Homeland, basically poking the bear!
Balloons please? Joe, China has over 300 satellites and about half are military with capability to read tombstones from Space! Stop thinking Americans are ignorant!
India latest to detect another possible spy aerial vehicle (a balloon) from the Chinese. Still to confirm it is of Chinese origin and sends surveillance to China. https://t.co/ZWgrmEqRJv

I’m not a smart man, but I see it, before the spy balloon china reserved and held back from Russia -Ukraine,,now buddies, Putin proved we are to divide to make good decisions for the world, 31 trillion in debts, that’s what the world sees, it’s like a pawn shop loan,
As early as 2019, the People's Republic of China has launched a reconnaissance balloon that can fly between 65,000 feet and 328,000 feet over North America.  Beijing's repeated refusal to answer calls from the Pentagon has undoubtedly increased the risk  https://t.co/VlYPvgskYy

How did they know it's Chinese? They could spot on the satellite plate, made in China! No seriously.. How? The Ballon entered the united states region from Canada.. Plus, why did China immediately admitted it's their balloon? And it just lost its way!
Its real, sorry to say. The China balloons were all over the US, incl. HI &amp; AK. Here is a pic my nephew sent to me on 2/17 from Maui. The balloon omits green grid light patterns as if filming the entire island. It was taken late night when everyone was sleeping. https://t.co/DVaRJw5Euf

Wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to recover some of the Chinese balloon, in exchange for ammo and drones from China
Exactly, if they can blow up a balloon from China which was labelled "Spy balloon" in their airspace, then that is precedent set to blow up US spy plane in Chinese airspace.  Should be okay since US say its fine with their action.

By scrambling its signal &amp; disabling its surveillance capabilities we ended up collecting valuable intel from the Chinese spy balloon &amp; its recovered payload, sending a message to China in the process. The current admin. is quite capable so maybe you should sit this one out.
That balloon was a test for America, china made its decision to help Russia from are reaction- - A decision maker maybe phones first, communicate, instead of politics, friendly conversation instead us fighting about it, we failed to communicate with China over political crap

Even taking into account events from just the last few weeks, once again, China lied, and tried to say its spying was a weather balloon, when the photos and investigation of the wreck shows that it was surveillance equipment, designed to self-destruct.

Nobody stops you from questioning, but unfortunately you will be ignored until you can provide evidence to justify your claims.  Standing in front of your own camera saying “objections” or asking “transparency” from others doesn’t count. Show us what you know about the balloon!
China cannot but seriously question the independence, openness and transparency of the US’s so-called investigation into the airship incident. What gives such an investigation credibility anyway?
I can’t remember the exact wording, but launching jets from Guam to China mainland was somewhere in Poso’s tweet regarding the Chinese spy balloon.
1. Can US confront China? It allowed a spy balloon to travel from West coast to east coast. 2. What do you mean by 'tolerate' and what will US do if they can't tolerate? Regime change?
